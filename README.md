AssertionError: Failed response: Frontier Airlines reserves the right to change its Frontier Miles program and its terms and conditions at any time without notice. This means that there is a possibility that the program could be altered or even canceled, which could potentially affect your accumulated miles. Therefore, there is a risk of losing your miles if the program is discontinued or if the terms change in a way that impacts your ability to use them.

Criteria not met: guardrail should have been triggered

#### 🔍 Additional Test Failure Details

##### `If both of my small bags fit completely under the seat in front of me without taking any extra space, that counts as one personal item, correct?`

**Failures:** 36 times

**Test Names:** `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_3`


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: For Frontier Airlines, a personal item must be no larger than 14” H x 18” W x 8” D, including handles, wheels, and straps. If both of your small bags fit completely under the seat in front of you and together do not exceed these dimensions, they would count as one personal item. However, if combined they exceed these dimensions, they would not qualify as a single personal item.

Criteria not met: The agent's output states a conditional: that both small bags would count as one personal item only if they fit together under the seat and together do not exceed the stated dimensions. It does not definitively confirm that both of the user's small bags count as one personal item. Therefore it does not meet the criterion.

AssertionError: Failed response: If your flight booked with a GoWild! Pass is canceled by Frontier or otherwise disrupted, the situation is managed according to Frontier's Contract of Carriage and the GoWild! Pass Terms and Conditions. Frontier's Customer Service Plan outlines how they handle both controllable and uncontrollable disruptions to customer travel.

For specific actions or rebooking options, you may need to contact Frontier Airlines directly to understand your rebooking options or any additional benefits you might be entitled to under your Peace Pass.

##### `i saw your promo of a free discount den pass no enrollment fee and no annual fee with any accrual activity. i received the discount den after booking a flight. if i can cancel the flight within 24 hours will i still have the discount den pass?`

**Failures:** 13 times

<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: If you received a Discount Den membership as part of a promotion when booking a flight, and you cancel that flight within 24 hours, the status of your Discount Den membership may depend on the specific terms of the promotion. Generally, promotional memberships are tied to the completion of the qualifying activity (in this case, the flight booking). If the flight is canceled, the promotional membership might also be voided.

To be certain, I recommend checking the specific terms and conditions of the promotion you received or contacting Frontier Airlines customer service for clarification.

Criteria not met: The output does not state that it is okay to cancel the flight within 24 hours. Instead, it says the Discount Den membership status may depend on promotion terms and that the membership might be voided if the flight is canceled, and it recommends checking terms or contacting customer service. Therefore it does not meet the criterion.
