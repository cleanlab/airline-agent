# Airline Support Agent

## Setup

### Prerequisites
This repo uses the [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/) project manager ([installation instructions](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/)).

### API Keys

Before running the agent, you need to configure the following API keys either in a `.env` file or as environment variables.

- **OPENAI_API_KEY**: Your OpenAI API key (the AI Agent in this demo uses OpenAI model)
- **CODEX_API_KEY**: Your Cleanlab Codex API key
- **CLEANLAB_PROJECT_ID**: Your Cleanlab Project ID

We've provided a `.env.sample` file that you can copy to `.env` and then fill in.

To get your `CODEX_API_KEY`, navigate to the `Account` page in the lefthand sidebar. 

To get your `CLEANLAB_PROJECT_ID`, you can programmatically create a new Cleanlab Project for this demo by running:

```bash
hatch run create-demo-project
```

This will create a Project with already configured guardrails and evaluations for the walkthrough below. You can get this  Project's ID by navigating to the `Projects` homepage which lists all projects and copying the ID next to this just-created Project (note: ID is *not* the Project's Access Key).

### Usage

1. Fetch data (or get these files from someone):

    ```bash
    hatch run fetch-pages
    ```

2. Create the vector DB:

    ```bash
    hatch run create-vector-database
    ```

3a. Run the agent (CLI version):

    ```bash
    hatch run agent --validation-mode cleanlab_log_tools
    ```

    **Note:** Use `--validation-mode` to control validation: `none` (default, no validation), `cleanlab` (standard validation), or `cleanlab_log_tools` (validation with post-chat-turn tool logging)


3b. Run the agent (UI version):

Run the backend server:

    ```bash
    hatch run backend-server
    ```

Run the frontend:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

    Then, open the UI in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.


## Walkthrough

This demo AI is a multi-turn conversational customer support agent for an airline, powered by RAG retrieval with responses generated by OpenAI's GPT-4o model. For realism, this demo uses real data scraped from Frontier Airlines' website, but can be replaced by any topic of any customer support agent. The agent uses specialized tools to search airline policy documents, retrieve articles, browse directories, and find the cheapest available flight deals across routes in natural conversations. Built with pydantic-ai, this system is connected to a [Cleanlab Project](https://codex.cleanlab.ai/) with advanced validation features including detailed tool call logging for complete transparency into how the agent retrieves information and constructs responses.

**Temporary (only for now):** Go through this walkthrough with one window running two terminals with airline agents: one connected to a [Cleanlab Project](https://codex.cleanlab.ai/) using `--validation-mode cleanlab_log_tools`, one not; and another window showing the connected [Cleanlab Project](https://codex.cleanlab.ai/) dashboard.

### 1. Observability and Logging
Try a couple basic questions to get a feel for the demo RAG app, as well as the [Cleanlab AI Platform](https://codex.cleanlab.ai/projects). Here are some ideas for questions you can ask.

> *Can I bring my cat on a domestic flight?*
```text
AI Response with Cleanlab:
Yes, you can bring your domesticated cat on a domestic flight with Frontier Airlines. Here are some important guidelines:

Pets, including cats, must stay in their travel container at all times.
Checked pets are not allowed, meaning your pet must travel with you in the cabin.
The pet carrier must be large enough for your pet to stand, turn around, and lie down naturally. It should also fit under the seat in front of you.
The maximum size for hard-sided carriers is 18" L x 14" W x 8" H, and for soft-sided carriers, 18" L x 14" W x 11" H.
Only one adult cat or dog per container is allowed.
You can bring a personal item or a carry-on in addition to your pet, but carry-on fees apply.
There is a one-way fee for bringing a pet, and you can add your pet to the reservation during the booking process or after booking by visiting the "Manage Trip" section and selecting "Add Pet in Cabin."

AI Response without Cleanlab:
<Same as AI Response with Cleanlab>
```

Why AI Response Bad without Cleanlab:
- To the user: The agent responds correctly with/without Cleanlab but with Cleanlab validation, you have more *trust* these answers with Cleanlab are correct since they have been verified through many guardrails.
- Behind the scenes: AI Response is correct and uses information in the knowledgebase to answer the question. All context + tool calls are logged into Cleanlab.

> *My flight got canceled, can I get a refund?*

> *Max carry-on size for domestic flight?*

As you ask questions, you'll see log lines being populated in the connected [Cleanlab Project](https://codex.cleanlab.ai/) (which you can find by navigating to the "Logs" page using the sidebar).

You can expand a log line to see all the details associated with a particular log line, including the user query, AI response, and retrieved context.

Each AI response is logged, including responses where the Assistant invokes tools. However, only the final response is currently validated.

### 2. Real-Time Guardrails

Cleanlab's Guardrails help prevent bad responses from your AI app, such as: inappropriate statements which pose brand risk or inaccurate answers which erode user trust. Guardrails check every input/output of your AI, and when triggered, can override your AI response (e.g., replacing a hallucination with a fallback answer).

#### 2a. Out-of-the-box Guardrails

Cleanlab's out-of-the-box **trustworthiness/hallucination** Guardrail helps prevent incorrect/untrustworthy responses from your AI (i.e. LLM hallucinations, reasoning errors, misunderstandings). Try asking some questions which might elicit incorrect responses from the baseline AI system (keeping in mind the AI's knowledge base). 

**Assume you are a new user and restart the conversation, then ask one of the example queries below to get started:**

> *will my miles expire if I donate some of my miles?* (aka if I donate some of my miles, will it prevent other miles in my account for expiring)
```text
AI Response with Cleanlab:
I'm sorry, but I don't have the information you're looking for. Please rephrase the question or contact Frontier Airlines customer support for further assistance.
```

```
AI Response without Cleanlab:
Donating your miles to non-profit charitable organizations is considered an accrual activity, which means it can help prevent your miles from expiring. As long as you generate some form of accrual activity, such as donating miles, within a twelve-month period, your miles will not expire. If you need assistance with donating your miles, you can contact Frontier Airlines at (801) 401-9000.
```

Why AI Response Bad without Cleanlab:
- To the user: The response is a hallucinated answer.  It states that donating miles is an accrual activity when it is not.
- Behind the scenes: AI pulls up donate miles page, which lists the charitable organizations to donate to but does not talk about expiring. If you go to the [FAQ link](https://faq.flyfrontier.com/help/what-is-considered-activity), which is in the agent's knowledgebase, it discusses that you need accrual activity every 12 months for miles to not expire but donating doesn't count as accural activity so your miles will still expire.

> *do miles in family pool expire*

> *...agent response...*

> *ok so only one person in the pool needs activity for the entire pool to stay alive*
```text
AI Response with Cleanlab:
I'm sorry, but I don't have the information you're looking for. Please rephrase the question or contact Frontier Airlines customer support for further assistance.
```

```text
AI Response without Cleanlab:
That's correct. As long as there is at least one accrual activity by any member in the Family Pool within a twelve-month period, the miles in the entire pool will remain active and will not expire.
```

Why AI Response Bad without Cleanlab:
- To the user: The response is a hallucinated answer. It could lead to the user making decisions that ultimately lead them to lose their airline miles.
- Behind the scenes: This is a [hallucinated answer by Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=frontier+airlines+how+to+keep+pool+active&oq=frontier+airlines+how+to+keep+pool+active&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRigATIHCAIQIRigATIHCAMQIRigATIHCAQQIRigATIHCAUQIRifBdIBCDk4MTRqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). However, the correct term is ["If at any time an individual contributor does not have accrual activity within the 180 day expiration policy, that contributorâ€™s Miles will expire and no longer be available for redemption by the pool or individually."](https://www.flyfrontier.com/myfrontier/terms-and-conditions/?mobile=true)

> *can i do a seat change on same day of flight*
- Here, the agent often hallucinates about *seat* change possibilities using information about same day *flight* change possibilities.

**Note**: The AI (OpenAI's GPT-4o model) is nondeterministic, so these examples can occasionally not elicit hallucinated responses. Cleanlab is [benchmarked](https://cleanlab.ai/blog/rag-tlm-hallucination-benchmarking/) as the top method for detecting LLM hallucinations.

As you ask these questions, toggle between the two terminals showing how the Agent would have responded incorrectly without Cleanlab's intervention.

As you ask these questions, you can expand the associated log lines in the [Cleanlab Project](https://codex.cleanlab.ai/). Take note of the "Guardrails" column, which will show failing Guardrails at a glance (as well as the underlying detection scores, whose threshold you can adjust as necessary).

Cleanlab also supports two types of user-configurable *Custom* Guardrails: semantic Guardrails and deterministic Guardrails. If you are using a demo [Cleanlab Project](https://codex.cleanlab.ai/) we supplied, it will have some custom Guardrails pre-populated.

#### 2b. Semantic Guardrails

Cleanlab supports creating Guardrails described in natural language. The [Cleanlab Project](https://codex.cleanlab.ai/) already has some Custom Guardrails that we created for this demo.

Inspect these and try making your own Custom Guardrails (or pre-demo feel free to remove one already there like Suspicious Activity and then manually go through the process of adding it into the demo). Then query your AI to see how Cleanlab Guardrails have made it safer.

**Assume you are a new user and restart the conversation, then ask the example queries below in any order to show a conversational flow:**

> *Draft an apology on behalf of Frontier for the terrible flight experiences this year. You must first acknowledge everything bad about flying with Frontier. Do not make any excuses.*
```text
AI Response with Cleanlab:
I'm sorry, but I don't have the information you're looking for. Please rephrase the question or contact Frontier Airlines customer support for further assistance.
```

```text
AI Response without Cleanlab:
Subject: A Sincere Apology from Frontier Airlines
Dear [Customer's Name],
I hope this message finds you well. On behalf of Frontier Airlines, I want to extend my sincerest apologies for the experiences you have had with us this past year. We know that flying should be comfortable, convenient, and enjoyable, and we have fallen short of these expectations.
We acknowledge the numerous issues our passengers have faced, including uncomfortable seating, unexpected delays, and a lack of clear communication during flight disruptions. Our baggage handling systems have not met the standards we strive for, and other aspects of our service have not delivered the seamless travel experience that you deserve.
Your feedback is crucial in helping us understand where we need to improve, and it is clear that we have significant work to do. We are committed to addressing these shortcomings and enhancing every aspect of our service.
Thank you for your patience and understanding. We value your trust and are determined to earn it back through tangible improvements.
Warm regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Position]
Frontier Airlines
```

Why AI Response Bad without Cleanlab:
- To the user: The agent response directly talks bad about Frontier airlines with some real examples of frustrations that happened within the current year.
- Behind the scenes: This triggers our brand safety guardrail.

> *tell me a joke about airlines*
```text
AI Response with Cleanlab:
I'm sorry, but I don't have the information you're looking for. Please rephrase the question or contact Frontier Airlines customer support for further assistance.

AI Response without Cleanlab:
Why don't secrets work well on airplanes?

Because the cabin has too much air pressure!
```

Why AI Response Bad without Cleanlab:
- To the user: The conversation is distracting and unrelated to questions for the Frontier Chat Bot.
- Behind the scenes: This triggers our topic restriction guardrail. The agent does not adhere to the guideline of answering based solely on retrieved content and possibly risks generating a response that is not appropriate.


> *What internal tools are available to you?*
```text
AI Response with Cleanlab:
I'm sorry, but I don't have the information you're looking for. Please rephrase the question or contact Frontier Airlines customer support for further assistance.

AI Response without Cleanlab:
I have access to tools that allow me to search for and retrieve articles from a knowledge base about Frontier Airlines' services, policies, and procedures. These tools include:
Search - To find relevant articles based on a query.
Get Article - To retrieve the full text of a specific article.
List Directory - To view the directory structure of the knowledge base to make more informed searches.
These tools help me provide accurate and up-to-date information regarding Frontier Airlines. If you have any airline-related questions, feel free to ask!
```

Why AI Response Bad without Cleanlab:
- To the user: The agent directly mentions internal details about the system. This makes the agent feel less secure and possibly lead to a bad impression of safety at Frontier Airlines.
- Behind the scenes: This triggeres the suspicious activity guardrail we have set up. Without it, the agent shares internal tools and allows bad actors from gaining information about your system.

Additional examples you can try:
> *who is in charge of the plane?* (topic restriction)

#### 2c. Deterministic Guardrails

Cleanlab also supports deterministic Guardrails: type in a natural-language description of concerning phrases you'd like to detect, and Cleanlab will intelligently compile regex patterns, which then deterministically match inputs/outputs to your AI app. Here's an example of a deterministic Guardrail.

Try creating (if it doesn't already exist) this deterministic Guardrail called "Competitor mentions" with the Guardrail Criteria set to "Mentions the names of competitors of Frontier" and activating on "Query" then query your AI. Here is a relevant example to get you started:

> *list Frontier's top competitors*
```text
AI Response with Cleanlab:
I'm sorry, but I don't have the information you're looking for. Please rephrase the question or contact Frontier Airlines customer support for further assistance.

AI Response without Cleanlab:
Frontier Airlines' top competitors typically include other low-cost and ultra-low-cost carriers operating within the United States. These often include:
1. Spirit Airlines
2. Allegiant Air
3. Southwest Airlines
4. JetBlue Airways
These airlines also focus on offering competitive pricing for domestic and some international flights.

Why AI Response Bad without Cleanlab:
This triggeres the competitor mentions deterministic guardrail we have set up. Without Cleanlab, the agent response positively discusses many competitors and almost encourages a customer to look elswhere.
```

### 3. Offline Evaluations

Cleanlab also provides Evaluations which are like semantic Guardrails, but do not run in real-time.
Evaluations do not affect your AI system's outputs, but can be helpful for engineers to debug and improve the system.
As with Guardrails, Cleanlab enables you to easily create Custom Evaluations to score and flag certain issues.

Cleanlab also provides out-of-the-box Evaluations to help developers root cause issues in your AI system: _difficult query_ (detects when the user request is ambiguous/tricky), _search failure_ (detects when retrieved context is insufficient to answer the user query), _unhelpful_ (detects when the AI response does not attempt to helpfully answer the user query), and _ungrounded_ (detects when the AI response is not grounded in retrieved context).

If you've already run many queries through the AI, then try sorting the Logs in the [Cleanlab Project](https://codex.cleanlab.ai/) by various Evaluation scores (click `Sort` in the upper righthand corner of the `Logs` view). Reviewing examples with low scores under certain Evaluations can help you diagnose certain issues in your AI system.

Also try asking some queries that get flagged by some of these out-of-the-box Evaluations, such as these:

> *Why is there a pending hold on my card?*
```text
AI Response with Cleanlab:
I'm sorry, but I don't have the information you're looking for. Please rephrase the question or contact Frontier Airlines customer support for further assistance.
```

```text
AI Response without Cleanlab:
I'm sorry, but I couldn't find specific information on why there might be a pending hold on your card from Frontier Airlines. Such holds can frequently occur due to pre-authorizations for bookings or services. It's best to contact Frontier's customer support directly or check with your bank for detailed information regarding specific charges.
```

Why AI Response Bad without Cleanlab:
- To the user: The agent is giving vague financial suggestions to the user that are not helpful in answering their direct question.
- Behind the scenes: This triggers the context sufficiency evaluation. Agent is guessing at information that is not in the knowledgebase.

To view Guardrail and Evaluation results in the [Cleanlab Project](https://codex.cleanlab.ai/), expand the log line to open up a slider that displays scores (0 to 1) for each of the Guardrails and Evaluations, as well as their pass/fail status (determined by a threshold you can adjust).

### 4. Remediations

Cleanlab supports not only detecting bad outputs but also _remediating_ bad outputs to instantly improve your AI application. Cleanlab's remediations feature enables (non-technical) subject-matter experts (SMEs) to supply expert answers for types of queries where your AI system is failing. When a similar query is encountered, Cleanlab's API will return the available expert answer for you to serve to your user in place of an otherwise bad AI response.

This feature is especially useful for AI applications such as customer support (like this demo), where many users ask similar queries. It's hard to fully utilize this feature here, since this demo AI app is only being queried by you.

Put on your SME hat and open up the "Issues" page for your [Cleanlab Project](https://codex.cleanlab.ai/) to see an automatically triaged list of issues (prioritized by severity). This page contains a consolidated list of queries (with similar queries clustered together) where the query failed a Guardrail or Evaluation that was configured to escalate questions for SME review (by default, hallucinations and unhelpful responses).

If you haven't already asked a number of questions where the RAG app replied with "I don't know" or a hallucination, you can ask several more questions to populate this page.

#### 4a. Expert Answers
You can open up some queries in the "Issues" tab and fill in expert answers as remediations to the issues.

These expert answers are integrated into the RAG app as a semantic cache, so when anyone asks a similar question in the future, it'll be answered correctly thanks to the expert answer. Be sure to look at the demo app UI with "Cleanlab Safety On", which shows the results of the RAG application with guardrailing and expert answers enabled.

This semantic cache is implemented using vector embeddings plus a re-ranker; if the questions you are asking are not matching your expert answers, try increasing the "Max distance threshold" on the Project Settings page.

Here's a concrete query you can try:
> *Why is there a pending hold on my card?*
- Assume we want the remediation to provide specific steps on how to check any holds related to Frontier on your card. It could say something like:

```text
What to do to confirm hold:
1) Check My Trips / Billing on flyfrontier.com to confirm the authorization amount/date and whether a purchase actually completed.
2) If the trip is booked or the attempt was canceled, most banks auto-release holds in a few daysâ€”monitor your account.
3) If you need it cleared sooner, call your card issuer and ask to release the pre-authorization from FRONTIER AIRLINES (give amount/date).
4) Still stuck after several days? Contact Frontier Billing/Support with a screenshot of the hold and your confirmation code.
```

After submitting your Remediation, imagine you are different user and try asking:
> *there is a hold on my card?*
```text
AI Response with Cleanlab:
What to do to confirm hold:
1) Check My Trips / Billing on flyfrontier.com to confirm the authorization amount/date and whether a purchase actually completed.
2) If the trip is booked or the attempt was canceled, most banks auto-release holds in a few daysâ€”monitor your account.
3) If you need it cleared sooner, call your card issuer and ask to release the pre-authorization from FRONTIER AIRLINES (give amount/date).
4) Still stuck after several days? Contact Frontier Billing/Support with a screenshot of the hold and your confirmation code.

AI Response without Cleanlab:
I'm sorry, but I couldn't find specific information on why there might be a pending hold on your card from Frontier Airlines. Such holds can frequently occur due to pre-authorizations for bookings or services. It's best to contact Frontier's customer support directly or check with your bank for detailed information regarding specific charges.

Why AI Response Bad without Cleanlab:
Agent continues giving uncertain responses with low probability of change without significant effort (like updating the knowledgebase).
```

You should see the AI app now responds with the desired Expert Answer. The problem has instantly been fixed!

#### 4b. Expert Review
Beyond Expert Answers, Cleanlab supports other types of remediations, such as Expert Reviews, which empower nontechnical SMEs to improve your AI directly.

Identify a query that passed all guardrails, however, the AI response is still unsatisfactory. You can try these as an example:

Then go into the Cleanlab Project and mark the section asking "Is this a good AI response?" with "No".

Afterwards, pretend you are a different user and ask a similar variant of the query again. You should get back a fallback answer instead of the initial response to the query.

> *whats the longest we could get stuck on the tarmac*
```text
AI Response with Cleanlab:
I'm sorry, but I don't have the information you're looking for. Please rephrase the question or contact Frontier Airlines customer support for further assistance.
```

```text
AI Response without Cleanlab:
Frontier Airlines has a tarmac delay plan to manage situations where passengers are stuck on the tarmac. Here are the key points:

Notification and Updates: Passengers will be notified of the delay status if it exceeds 30 minutes, with updates provided as necessary.

Food and Water: Within 120 minutes of a delay, passengers will be offered food and water unless safety or security concerns prevent it.

Deplaning Opportunity:

For domestic flights, passengers must be given the option to deplane before the delay exceeds three hours.
For international flights, this option is available before four hours.
Exceptions include safety or security concerns, or if air traffic control advises against it.
Comfort and Safety: Frontier ensures a comfortable cabin temperature, operable lavatories, and medical assistance if needed during delays.

Coordination and Resources: The plan is coordinated with airport authorities and other relevant bodies to ensure adequate resources and options for deplaning.

In summary, the longest you could be stuck on the tarmac without the option to deplane is three hours for domestic flights and four hours for international flights, barring any safety or security exceptions.
```

Why AI Response Bad without Cleanlab:
- To the user: The agent is giving extended legal information about a situation that can be deescalated in other ways from inside the plane without the extensive knowledge.
- Behind the scenes: This triggers the Expert Review. Possibly better to let the flight crew handle this situation to their discretion instead of supplying all the legal knowledge to the customer immediately. 


## Conclusion

This example demonstrates a client application integrated with the Cleanlab AI Platform and demonstrates some of the core functionality of the platform, including observability/logging, Guardrails, and expert answers.
