```
AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC, it's important to consider both TSA regulations and the laws of the states you are traveling to and from. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Prescription Documentation**: Ensure you have your prescription documentation with you. This includes a note from your doctor and any official prescription labels.

2. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, they recommend keeping medications in your carry-on for easy access and to prevent loss.

3. **State Laws**: Check the laws regarding THC in both your departure and arrival states. While some states have legalized medical and recreational marijuana, others have not, and federal law still classifies marijuana as a controlled substance.

4. **Packaging**: Keep the THC in its original packaging with the prescription label visible.

5. **Security Screening**: Be prepared to declare your medication at the security checkpoint. TSA officers have the discretion to allow or prohibit items through the checkpoint.

It's always a good idea to check the latest TSA guidelines and consult with your airline if you have specific concerns.

Criteria not met: The output explicitly states that “federal law still classifies marijuana as a controlled substance,” which mentions federal illegality. This violates the criterion that the output must not mention that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_2`

**Failures:** 2 times

<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: If you received a Discount Den membership as part of a promotion when booking a flight, and you cancel that flight within 24 hours, the status of your Discount Den membership may depend on the specific terms of the promotion. Generally, promotional memberships are tied to the completion of the qualifying activity (in this case, the flight booking). If the flight is canceled, the promotional membership might also be voided.

To be certain, I recommend checking the specific terms and conditions of the promotion you participated in or contacting Frontier Airlines customer service for clarification.

Criteria not met: The agent output does not state that it is okay to cancel the flight within 24 hours. Instead, it says the Discount Den membership 'may depend' on the promotion and that the membership 'might also be voided,' and recommends checking terms or contacting customer service. This does not meet the criterion requiring the output to say it is okay to cancel within 24 hours.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_3`

**Failures:** 3 times

**Question:** If both of my small bags fit completely under the seat in front of me without taking any extra space, that counts as one personal item, correct?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: For Frontier Airlines, a personal item must be no larger than 14” H x 18” W x 8” D, including handles, wheels, and straps. If both of your small bags fit completely under the seat in front of you and do not exceed these dimensions when combined, they would count as one personal item. However, typically only one personal item is allowed per passenger, so combining two bags to fit these dimensions might not be permissible unless they are contained within a single bag or structure.

Criteria not met: The agent output is ambiguous and does not definitively confirm that both small bags count as one personal item. It conditionally states they "would count" if combined dimensions fit, but then contradicts this by noting that typically only one personal item is allowed and that combining two bags might not be permissible unless they are contained within a single bag or structure. Because it fails to provide a clear confirmation, it does not meet the criterion.

**Question:** Do miles in family pool expire?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: In a Frontier Airlines family pool, miles do not expire as long as there is accrual activity in the account every twelve months. This means that if any member of the family pool generates activity, such as earning miles through purchases or other eligible activities, the miles for the entire pool will remain active.

##### `tests/stable/test_remediations.py::test_additional_expert_guidance_1`

**Failures:** 17 times

**Question:** can i bring a dog with me on a flight?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Frontier Airlines does not accept emotional support animals on their flights. Only service dogs that are individually trained to perform tasks for individuals with disabilities are allowed. If your dog is a service animal, it must meet specific requirements and documentation may be needed. For more details on service animal requirements, you can visit Frontier's Special Services page.

Criteria not met: The agent output only states general policy points (no emotional support animals; service dogs allowed and may require documentation) and refers to Frontier's Special Services page. It does not provide any specific requirements for pets on domestic flights (no age minimums, carrier size/type, or weight limits) nor any specific requirements for service animals on international flights (no documentation details such as CDC Dog Import Form receipt, microchip proof, or vaccination requirements). Therefore it fails to meet the criteria requiring BOTH sets of specific requirements.
