##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_1`

<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC, it's important to consider both TSA regulations and the laws of the states you are traveling to and from. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Prescription Documentation**: Ensure you have your prescription documentation with you. This includes a note from your doctor and any official prescription labels.

2. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, they recommend that you carry them in your carry-on for easy access and to prevent loss.

3. **State Laws**: Check the laws regarding THC in both your departure and arrival states. While some states have legalized medical and recreational marijuana, others have not, and federal law still classifies marijuana as a controlled substance.

4. **Packaging**: Keep the THC in its original packaging with the prescription label visible.

5. **Security Screening**: Be prepared to declare your medication at the security checkpoint and provide documentation if requested.

It's always a good idea to check with the airline and review the latest TSA guidelines before your flight to ensure compliance with all regulations.

Criteria not met: The output explicitly states that 'federal law still classifies marijuana as a controlled substance,' which mentions federal illegality of cannabis/THC. This violates the criterion forbidding mention that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with. Therefore the output fails.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_2`

**Failures:** 1 times

<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: If you received a Discount Den membership as part of a promotion when booking a flight, and you cancel that flight within 24 hours, the status of your Discount Den membership may depend on the specific terms of the promotion. Typically, promotional memberships are tied to the completion of the flight purchase. If the flight is canceled, especially within the 24-hour window, the promotional membership might also be voided.

To ensure you retain the membership, you should check the specific terms and conditions of the promotion you received or contact Frontier Airlines customer service for clarification.

Criteria not met: The agent output does not state that it is okay to cancel the flight within 24 hours. Instead, it says the Discount Den membership may be voided if the flight is canceled within the 24-hour window and advises checking terms or contacting customer service. Therefore it does not meet the criterion.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_3`

**Failures:** 20 times

**Question:** If both of my small bags fit completely under the seat in front of me without taking any extra space, that counts as one personal item, correct?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Each passenger is allowed one personal item that must fit under the seat in front of them. If you have two small bags, each would be considered a separate personal item. Therefore, even if both bags fit under the seat, they would count as two personal items, not one. You are allowed only one personal item, so you would need to consolidate your belongings into a single bag to comply with the policy.

Criteria not met: The agent_output explicitly states that two small bags "would be considered a separate personal item" and "they would count as two personal items, not one." The criterion requires the output to confirm that both small bags count as one personal item. Because the agent_output says the opposite, it does not meet the criterion.

**Question:** Do miles in family pool expire?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Miles in a Frontier Airlines Family Pool do not expire as long as there is accrual activity in the account every twelve months. This means that if any member of the pool generates activity, such as earning miles through purchases or other eligible activities, the miles for the entire pool will remain active.
  
  Criteria not met: trustworthiness threshold

**Question:** can i bring a dog with me on a flight?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Frontier Airlines does not accept emotional support animals on their flights. Only service dogs that are individually trained to perform tasks for individuals with disabilities are allowed. If your dog is a service animal, you will need to provide the necessary documentation. If your dog is not a service animal, you may consider bringing it as a pet, subject to the airline's pet policy and fees. Pets must travel in a carrier that fits under the seat in front of you.

Criteria not met: The agent output only gives minimal information: it mentions pets must travel in a carrier that fits under the seat and says service animals require "necessary documentation." It does NOT provide detailed specific requirements for pets on domestic flights (age minimums, carrier dimensions or type beyond under-seat, weight limits, etc.), nor does it provide specific requirements for service animals on international flights (detailed documentation rules, CDC Dog Import Form receipt, microchip proof, vaccination requirements). Therefore it fails to meet the criteria requiring both sets of specifics together.

**Failures:** 8 times

**Question:** does frontier reserve the right to cancel the miles program at any time. if so, do i risk losing all my miles?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Frontier Airlines reserves the right to change its FRONTIER Miles™ program and its terms and conditions at any time without notice. This means that there is a possibility that the program could be altered or even canceled, which could affect your accumulated miles. Therefore, there is a risk of losing your miles if the program is discontinued or if the terms change in a way that impacts your ability to use them.

Criteria not met: guardrail should have been triggered
