##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_1`

**Failures:** 54 times

**Question:** can i pack my prescription thc in my carry on so that its accessible to me during my flight? ill need it if i get an anxiety attack on take off.


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC, it's important to consider both TSA regulations and the laws of the states you are traveling to and from. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law. TSA officers are required to report any suspected violations of law, including possession of marijuana and cannabis-infused products.

2. **Prescription Documentation**: If you have a prescription for THC, it is advisable to carry documentation, such as a doctor's note or the prescription itself, to verify its medical necessity.

3. **State Laws**: Ensure that both your departure and arrival states allow the possession of medical marijuana. Laws can vary significantly between states.

4. **Airline Policies**: Check with Frontier Airlines for any specific policies they may have regarding the transport of medical marijuana.

Given these considerations, while you may be able to carry your prescription THC in your carry-on, it is crucial to be aware of and comply with all relevant laws and regulations. If in doubt, consult legal advice or contact the airline directly for guidance.

Criteria not met: The output explicitly states that “marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products ... remain illegal under federal law,” which mentions federal illegality of THC/cannabis. This violates the criterion that the output must not mention that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_2`

**Failures:** 5 times

**Question:** i saw your promo of a free discount den pass no enrollment fee and no annual fee with any accrual activity. i received the discount den after booking a flight. if i can cancel the flight within 24 hours will i still have the discount den pass?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: If you received a Discount Den membership as part of a flight booking and then cancel that flight within 24 hours, the status of your Discount Den membership would depend on the specific terms and conditions associated with the promotion you used. Typically, promotional memberships are tied to the completion of the qualifying activity (in this case, the flight). If the flight is canceled, the promotional membership might also be voided.

To be certain, I recommend checking the specific terms and conditions of the promotion you received or contacting Frontier Airlines customer service for clarification.

Criteria not met: The agent output does not state that it is okay to cancel the flight within 24 hours. Instead it says the membership status depends on the promotion’s terms and that the membership might be voided if the flight is canceled, and it recommends checking terms or contacting customer service. Therefore it does not meet the criterion.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_3`

**Failures:** 34 times

**Question:** If both of my small bags fit completely under the seat in front of me without taking any extra space, that counts as one personal item, correct?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: On Frontier Airlines, each passenger is allowed to bring one personal item on board for free. A personal item must fit under the seat in front of you and typically includes items like a purse, briefcase, or small backpack. If you have two small bags, each must individually qualify as a personal item by fitting under the seat. If both bags fit under the seat together without taking extra space, they might still be considered as two separate items. It's important to ensure that you adhere to the airline's specific size and quantity restrictions for personal items.

Criteria not met: The agent_output explicitly states that each passenger is allowed one personal item and that if you have two small bags, each must individually qualify as a personal item; it even says they might still be considered as two separate items. This does not confirm that both small bags count as one personal item, so it fails the criterion.

**Question:** Do miles in family pool expire?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Miles in a Frontier Airlines Family Pool do not expire as long as there is accrual activity in the account every twelve months. This means that if any member of the pool generates activity, such as earning miles through purchases or other eligible activities, the miles for the entire pool will remain active.

AssertionError: Failed response: Yes, you can bring a domesticated dog on a Frontier Airlines flight within the U.S. for a one-way fee. Here are some important guidelines to keep in mind:

- Pets must stay in their travel container at all times.
- Checked pets are not allowed.

- It must fit under the seat in front of you.
- Maximum size for hard-sided carriers: 18" L x 14" W x 8" H.
- Maximum size for soft-sided carriers: 18" L x 14" W x 11" H.
- Soft-sided carriers are recommended.
- Only one adult dog or cat per container is allowed.
- You may bring one personal item or a carry-on in addition to your pet (carry-on fees apply).

You can add a pet to your reservation during booking by selecting "Cabin Pet" in the Passenger Info section, or after booking by visiting "Manage Trip" and selecting "Add Pet in Cabin."

If your flight is international or involves a service animal, please let me know so I can provide additional information.

**Question:** does frontier reserve the right to cancel the miles program at any time. if so, do i risk losing all my miles?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Frontier Airlines reserves the right to change its Frontier Miles program and its terms and conditions at any time without notice. This means that there is a possibility that the program could be altered or even canceled, which could potentially affect your accumulated miles. Therefore, while it is not common for airlines to cancel such programs outright, there is a risk that changes could impact your miles.
