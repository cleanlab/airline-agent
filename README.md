##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_1`

**Failures:** 48 times

**Question:** can i pack my prescription thc in my carry on so that its accessible to me during my flight? ill need it if i get an anxiety attack on take off.


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC, it's important to consider both TSA regulations and the laws of the states you are traveling to and from. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Prescription Documentation**: Ensure you have your prescription documentation with you. This includes a note from your doctor and the original prescription label on the packaging.

2. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, they recommend that you carry them in your carry-on for easy access and to prevent loss.

3. **State Laws**: Check the laws regarding THC in both your departure and arrival states. While some states have legalized medical and recreational marijuana, others have not, and federal law still classifies marijuana as a controlled substance.

4. **Security Screening**: Be prepared for your medication to be inspected during the security screening process. It's helpful to inform the TSA officer that you are carrying prescription medication.

5. **Airline Policies**: While TSA handles security, airlines may have their own policies regarding the transport of THC products. It's a good idea to check with Frontier Airlines directly for any specific restrictions they might have.

If you have any concerns or need further clarification, consulting with legal counsel or the appropriate authorities might be beneficial.

Criteria not met: The agent output states that "federal law still classifies marijuana as a controlled substance," which explicitly references federal classification/illegality. This violates the criterion that the output must not mention that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with. Therefore the output fails the criterion.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_2`

**Failures:** 5 times

**Question:** i saw your promo of a free discount den pass no enrollment fee and no annual fee with any accrual activity. i received the discount den after booking a flight. if i can cancel the flight within 24 hours will i still have the discount den pass?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: If you received a Discount Den membership as part of a flight booking and then cancel that flight within 24 hours, the status of your Discount Den membership would depend on the specific terms and conditions associated with the promotion you used. Typically, promotional memberships are tied to the completion of the qualifying activity (in this case, the flight). If the flight is canceled, the promotional membership might also be voided.

To be certain, I recommend checking the specific terms and conditions of the promotion you received or contacting Frontier Airlines customer service for clarification.

Criteria not met: The agent output does not state that it is okay to cancel the flight within 24 hours. Instead it says the membership status depends on the promotion’s terms and that the membership might be voided if the flight is canceled, and it recommends checking terms or contacting customer service. Therefore it does not meet the criterion.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_3`

**Failures:** 32 times

**Question:** If both of my small bags fit completely under the seat in front of me without taking any extra space, that counts as one personal item, correct?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Each passenger is allowed one personal item that must fit under the seat in front of them. If you have two small bags, each would be considered a separate personal item. Therefore, even if both bags fit under the seat, they would count as two personal items, not one. You are allowed only one personal item without additional charges, so you would need to consolidate your items into a single bag to comply with the personal item policy.

Criteria not met: Fail — The agent output states that two small bags would be considered two personal items. The criterion requires the output to confirm that both small bags count as one personal item. Because the agent contradicts the criterion, it fails.

**Question:** Do miles in family pool expire?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Miles in a Frontier Airlines Family Pool do not expire as long as there is accrual activity in the account every twelve months. This means that if any member of the pool generates activity, such as earning miles through purchases or other eligible activities, the miles for the entire pool will remain active.

**Question:** does frontier reserve the right to cancel the miles program at any time. if so, do i risk losing all my miles?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Frontier Airlines reserves the right to change its Frontier Miles program and its terms and conditions at any time without notice. This means that there is a possibility that the program could be altered or even canceled, which could potentially affect your accumulated miles. Therefore, while it is not common for airlines to cancel such programs outright, there is a risk that changes could impact your miles.
