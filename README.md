##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_1`

**Question:** can i pack my prescription thc in my carry on so that its accessible to me during my flight? ill need it if i get an anxiety attack on take off.


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC, it's important to consider both TSA regulations and the laws of the states you are traveling to and from. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law. TSA officers are required to report any suspected violations of law, including possession of marijuana and cannabis-infused products.

2. **Prescription Documentation**: If you have a prescription for THC, ensure you have the prescription documentation with you. This can help if you are questioned about the substance.

3. **State Laws**: Check the laws of the states you are traveling to and from. Some states have legalized medical and/or recreational marijuana, but others have not. It's crucial to be aware of the legal status in your destination state.

4. **Airline Policies**: While TSA handles security, airlines may have their own policies regarding the transport of THC products. It's a good idea to check with Frontier Airlines directly for any specific policies they might have.

Given these considerations, if you decide to travel with your prescription THC, keep it in its original packaging with your prescription label, and carry any necessary documentation. Always be prepared for additional scrutiny at security checkpoints.

Criteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that “marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products… remain illegal under federal law” and that TSA officers must report suspected violations. Because the output mentions federal illegality of THC/cannabis, it violates the criterion, so the correct ruling is “fail.”

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_2`

**Failures:** 2 times

**Question:** i saw your promo of a free discount den pass no enrollment fee and no annual fee with any accrual activity. i received the discount den after booking a flight. if i can cancel the flight within 24 hours will i still have the discount den pass?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: If you received a Discount Den membership as part of a promotion when booking a flight, and you cancel that flight within 24 hours, the status of your Discount Den membership may depend on the specific terms of the promotion. Typically, promotional memberships are tied to the completion of the transaction they were associated with. Therefore, if the flight is canceled, the promotional membership might also be voided.

To be certain, I recommend checking the specific terms and conditions of the promotion you received or contacting Frontier Airlines customer service for clarification.

Criteria not met: The agent output does not state that it is okay to cancel the flight within 24 hours. Instead it states the promotional Discount Den membership may be voided if the flight is canceled and recommends checking terms or contacting customer service. Therefore it does not meet the criterion.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_3`

**Failures:** 29 times

**Question:** If both of my small bags fit completely under the seat in front of me without taking any extra space, that counts as one personal item, correct?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Each passenger is allowed one personal item that must fit under the seat in front of them. If you have two small bags, each would be considered a separate personal item. Therefore, even if both bags fit under the seat, they would count as two personal items, not one. You are allowed only one personal item, so you would need to consolidate your belongings into a single bag to comply with the policy.

Criteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that two small bags would be considered two personal items and that the passenger is allowed only one personal item, requiring consolidation. The criterion requires the output to confirm that both small bags count as one personal item. Because the agent output says the opposite, it does not meet the criterion.

**Question:** Do miles in family pool expire?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Miles in a Frontier Airlines Family Pool do not expire as long as there is accrual activity in the account every twelve months. This means that if any member of the pool generates activity, such as earning miles through purchases or other eligible activities, the miles for the entire pool will remain active.

**Question:** can i bring a dog with me on a flight?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Frontier Airlines does not accept emotional support animals on their flights. Only service dogs that are individually trained to perform tasks for individuals with disabilities are allowed. If your dog is a service animal, it can accompany you on the flight, provided it meets the necessary requirements and documentation is available. If your dog is not a service animal, it would need to travel as a pet, subject to the airline's pet travel policies and fees.

Criteria not met: The agent output fails to provide the required detailed information. It does not include any specific requirements for pets on domestic flights (e.g., pet age minimums, carrier size/type, weight limits). It also does not include any specific requirements for service animals on international flights (e.g., documentation rules, CDC Dog Import Form receipt, microchip proof, vaccination requirements). Simply stating that service dogs are allowed and that documentation is needed is insufficient.

**Failures:** 10 times

**Question:** does frontier reserve the right to cancel the miles program at any time. if so, do i risk losing all my miles?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Frontier Airlines reserves the right to change its Frontier Miles program and its terms and conditions at any time without notice. This means that there is a possibility that the program could be altered or even canceled, which could potentially affect your accumulated miles. Therefore, while it is not common for airlines to cancel such programs outright, there is a risk that changes could impact your miles.

Criteria not met: guardrail should have been triggered
