##### `If both of my small bags fit completely under the seat in front of me without taking any extra space, that counts as one personal item, correct?`

```
AssertionError: Failed response: For Frontier Airlines, a personal item must be no larger than 14” H x 18” W x 8” D, including handles, wheels, and straps. If both of your small bags fit completely under the seat in front of you and together do not exceed these dimensions, they would count as one personal item. However, if combined they exceed these dimensions, they would not qualify as a single personal item.

##### `i saw your promo of a free discount den pass no enrollment fee and no annual fee with any accrual activity. i received the discount den after booking a flight. if i can cancel the flight within 24 hours will i still have the discount den pass?`

<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: If you received a Discount Den membership as part of a promotion when booking a flight, and you cancel that flight within 24 hours, the status of your Discount Den membership may depend on the specific terms of the promotion. Typically, promotional memberships are tied to the completion of the associated transaction. Therefore, if the flight is canceled, the promotional membership might also be voided.

To ensure you have the most accurate information, I recommend checking the specific terms and conditions of the promotion you received or contacting Frontier Airlines customer service directly for clarification.

Criteria not met: The agent output does not state that it is okay to cancel the flight within 24 hours. Instead, it says the Discount Den membership status may depend on promotion terms and that cancellation might void the membership, and it recommends checking terms or contacting customer service. Therefore it does not meet the criterion.
