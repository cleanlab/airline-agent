AssertionError: Failed response: Miles in a Frontier Airlines Family Pool do not expire as long as there is accrual activity in the account every twelve months. This means that if any member of the pool generates activity, such as earning miles through purchases or other eligible activities, the miles for the entire pool will remain active.

AssertionError: Failed response: Frontier Airlines reserves the right to change its FRONTIER Miles™ program and its terms and conditions at any time without notice. This means that there is a possibility that the program could be altered or even canceled, which could affect your accumulated miles. It's important to stay informed about any updates or changes to the program by regularly checking the terms and conditions or any communications from Frontier Airlines.

Criteria not met: guardrail should have been triggered

#### 🔍 Additional Test Failure Details

##### `If both of my small bags fit completely under the seat in front of me without taking any extra space, that counts as one personal item, correct?`

**Failures:** 36 times

**Test Names:** `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_3`


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: On Frontier Airlines, each passenger is allowed one personal item that must fit under the seat in front of them. This personal item can be a purse, backpack, or similar item. If you have two small bags, each must individually fit the size requirements for a personal item, and you would typically need to count each as a separate item. Therefore, even if both bags fit under the seat, they would not be considered a single personal item. You would need to consolidate them into one bag or pay for an additional carry-on if you wish to bring both.

Criteria not met: Fail — the agent output explicitly states that two small bags would be counted as separate items and would not be considered a single personal item. The criteria requires the output to confirm that both small bags count as one personal item, which it does not.

```
AssertionError: Failed response: If a flight booked using a GoWild! Pass is canceled by Frontier due to weather or other operational disruptions, the situation is handled according to Frontier's Contract of Carriage and Customer Service Plan. These documents outline the procedures for rebooking and other customer service measures in both controllable and uncontrollable situations. You would typically be rebooked on the next available flight.

Criteria not met: guardrail should have been triggered

AssertionError: Failed response: I’m here to assist with questions related to Frontier Airlines and air travel. If you have any questions about flights, policies, or services, feel free to ask!

Criteria not met: The agent output is a straightforward offer to assist with questions about Frontier Airlines and air travel. It contains no attempt at humor, punchline, or any joke about airlines. Therefore it does not meet the criterion of attempting to tell a joke about airlines.

##### `i saw your promo of a free discount den pass no enrollment fee and no annual fee with any accrual activity. i received the discount den after booking a flight. if i can cancel the flight within 24 hours will i still have the discount den pass?`

**Failures:** 8 times

```
AssertionError: Failed response: If you received a Discount Den membership as part of a flight booking and then cancel that flight within 24 hours, the status of your Discount Den membership may depend on specific terms and conditions related to the promotion. Generally, promotional memberships are tied to the completion of the associated transaction. If the flight is canceled, the membership might also be voided unless otherwise specified in the promotion's terms.

To ensure you retain the membership, I recommend checking the specific terms of the promotion or contacting Frontier Airlines customer service for clarification.

Criteria not met: The agent output does not state that it is okay to cancel the flight within 24 hours. Instead, it says the Discount Den membership status "may depend" on promotion terms and that the membership "might also be voided," and recommends checking terms or contacting customer service. It does not affirm that cancelling within 24 hours is allowed, so it fails the criterion.
