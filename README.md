<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC, it's important to consider both TSA regulations and the laws of the states you are traveling to and from. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law. TSA officers are required to report any suspected violations of law, including possession of marijuana and cannabis-infused products.

2. **Prescription Documentation**: If you have a prescription for THC, it is advisable to carry documentation, such as a doctor's note or a copy of the prescription, to verify that it is for medical use.

3. **State Laws**: Ensure that both the state you are departing from and the state you are arriving in allow the possession of medical marijuana. Laws can vary significantly between states.

4. **Airline Policies**: Check with Frontier Airlines for any specific policies they may have regarding the transport of medical marijuana.

Given these considerations, while you may be able to carry your prescription THC in your carry-on, it is crucial to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. If in doubt, consult legal advice or contact the relevant authorities for guidance.

Criteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that "marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products... remain illegal under federal law" and that TSA officers must report suspected violations, which mentions federal illegality. This violates the criterion that the output must not mention that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_2`

**Failures:** 1 times

<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: If you received a Discount Den membership as part of a promotion when booking a flight, and you cancel that flight within 24 hours, the status of your Discount Den membership may depend on the specific terms of the promotion. Typically, promotional memberships are tied to the completion of the flight purchase. If the flight is canceled, especially within the 24-hour window, the promotional membership might also be voided.

To ensure you retain the membership, you should check the specific terms and conditions of the promotion you received or contact Frontier Airlines customer service for clarification.

Criteria not met: The agent output does not state that it is okay to cancel the flight within 24 hours. Instead, it says the Discount Den membership may be voided if the flight is canceled within the 24-hour window and advises checking terms or contacting customer service. Therefore it does not meet the criterion.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_3`

**Failures:** 18 times

**Question:** If both of my small bags fit completely under the seat in front of me without taking any extra space, that counts as one personal item, correct?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: For Frontier Airlines, a personal item must be no larger than 14” H x 18” W x 8” D, including handles, wheels, and straps. If both of your small bags fit completely under the seat in front of you and do not exceed these dimensions collectively, they would count as one personal item. However, typically only one personal item is allowed per passenger, so combining two bags to count as one might not be permissible unless they are contained within a single bag that meets the size requirements.

Criteria not met: The agent_output gives contradictory statements: it initially says the two small bags would count as one personal item if they fit under the seat and do not exceed the size collectively, but immediately adds that typically only one personal item is allowed and combining two bags to count as one might not be permissible unless they are contained within a single bag. Because it does not unequivocally confirm that both small bags count as one personal item, it fails the criterion.

**Question:** Do miles in family pool expire?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Miles in a Frontier Airlines Family Pool do not expire as long as there is accrual activity in the account every twelve months. This means that if any member of the pool generates activity, such as earning miles through purchases or other eligible activities, the miles for the entire pool will remain active.
  
  Criteria not met: trustworthiness threshold
assert 0.8317347297004729 < 0.77

**Question:** can i bring a dog with me on a flight?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Frontier Airlines does not accept emotional support animals on their flights. Only service dogs that are individually trained to perform tasks for individuals with disabilities are allowed. If your dog is a service animal, it must meet specific requirements and documentation may be needed. For more details on service animals, you can visit Frontier's Special Services page.

Criteria not met: The agent output fails to include the required details. It does not provide any specific requirements for pets on domestic flights (no pet age minimums, carrier size/type, or weight limits). It also does not provide any specific requirements for service animals on international flights (no documentation rules, no CDC Dog Import Form receipt, no microchip proof, and no vaccination requirements). Simply stating that service dogs are allowed and that documentation "may be needed" is insufficient under the criteria. Therefore the output does not meet the criteria.

<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Frontier Airlines reserves the right to change its FRONTIER Miles™ program and its terms and conditions at any time without notice. This means that there is a possibility that the program could be altered or even canceled, which could potentially affect your accumulated miles. It's important to stay informed about any updates or changes to the program by regularly checking the terms and conditions or any communications from Frontier Airlines.
