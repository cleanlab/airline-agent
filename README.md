<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC, it's important to consider both TSA regulations and the laws of the states you are traveling to and from. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Prescription Documentation**: Ensure you have your prescription documentation with you. This includes a note from your doctor and any relevant prescription labels.

2. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, they recommend that you carry them in your carry-on for easy access and to prevent loss.

3. **State Laws**: Be aware of the laws regarding THC in both your departure and arrival states. While some states have legalized medical and recreational marijuana, others have not, and federal law still classifies marijuana as a controlled substance.

4. **Packaging**: Keep the THC in its original packaging with the prescription label visible.

5. **Security Screening**: Be prepared to declare your medication at the security checkpoint and provide documentation if requested.

It's always a good idea to check the latest TSA guidelines and consult with your airline if you have specific concerns.

Criteria not met: Fail: The output explicitly states that "federal law still classifies marijuana as a controlled substance," which mentions that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with, so it does not meet the criterion.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_2`

**Failures:** 1 times

<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: If you received a Discount Den membership as part of a promotion when booking a flight, and you cancel that flight within 24 hours, the status of your Discount Den membership may depend on the specific terms of the promotion. Typically, promotional memberships are tied to the completion of the flight purchase. If the flight is canceled, especially within the 24-hour window, the promotional membership might also be voided.

To ensure you retain the membership, you should check the specific terms and conditions of the promotion you received or contact Frontier Airlines customer service for clarification.

Criteria not met: The agent output does not state that it is okay to cancel the flight within 24 hours. Instead, it says the Discount Den membership may be voided if the flight is canceled within the 24-hour window and advises checking terms or contacting customer service. Therefore it does not meet the criterion.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_3`

**Failures:** 7 times

**Question:** If both of my small bags fit completely under the seat in front of me without taking any extra space, that counts as one personal item, correct?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Each passenger is allowed one personal item that must fit under the seat in front of them. If you have two small bags, each would be considered a separate personal item. Therefore, even if both bags fit under the seat, they would count as two personal items, not one. You are allowed only one personal item, so you would need to consolidate your belongings into a single bag to comply with the policy.

Criteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that two small bags would be considered two personal items and must be consolidated into one; it does not confirm that both bags count as one personal item. Therefore it does not meet the criterion.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_trustworthiness_guardrail_2`

**Failures:** 3 times

**Question:** Do miles in family pool expire?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: In a Frontier Airlines family pool, the head of the pool is responsible for managing the miles. However, the information about whether only one person in the pool needs to have accrual activity to keep the entire pool's miles from expiring is not explicitly detailed in the available resources. Typically, accrual activity is required to prevent miles from expiring, but it's best to confirm specific policies directly with Frontier Airlines or through their official resources.

Criteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that the information is not explicitly detailed and does not confirm that only one person in the family pool needs accrual activity to keep the entire pool’s miles from expiring. Instead it advises confirming with Frontier. Therefore it does not meet the criterion requiring explicit confirmation that only one person’s activity suffices.

<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: I'm sorry, but I don't have the information you're looking for. Please rephrase the question or contact Frontier Airlines customer support for further assistance.

Criteria not met: The agent output does not ask any clarifying question about whether the user is asking about a domestic or international flight. It only apologizes and asks to rephrase or contact support. Therefore it fails the criterion.
