```
AssertionError: Failed response: Frontier Airlines reserves the right to change its FRONTIER Miles™ program and its terms and conditions at any time without notice. This means that there is a possibility that the program could be altered or even canceled, which could affect your accumulated miles. Therefore, there is a risk of losing your miles if the program is discontinued or if the terms change in a way that impacts your ability to use them.

Criteria not met: guardrail should have been triggered

#### 🔍 Additional Test Failure Details

##### `If both of my small bags fit completely under the seat in front of me without taking any extra space, that counts as one personal item, correct?`

**Failures:** 38 times

**Test Names:** `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_3`


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: On Frontier Airlines, each passenger is allowed to bring one personal item on board for free. A personal item must fit under the seat in front of you and typically includes items like a purse, briefcase, or small backpack. If you have two small bags, each must individually fit the size requirements for a personal item to be considered as such. If both bags fit under the seat but are separate, they would count as two personal items, and you would need to pay for the second one. Only one personal item is allowed for free per passenger.

Criteria not met: The agent_output explicitly states that two small bags would count as two personal items and that only one personal item is allowed for free. It does not confirm that both small bags count as one personal item, so it fails the criterion.

AssertionError: Failed response: If a flight booked using a GoWild! Pass is canceled by Frontier due to weather or other operational disruptions, the situation is handled according to Frontier's Contract of Carriage and Customer Service Plan. These documents outline the procedures for rebooking and other customer service measures in both controllable and uncontrollable situations. You would typically be rebooked on the next available flight.

##### `i saw your promo of a free discount den pass no enrollment fee and no annual fee with any accrual activity. i received the discount den after booking a flight. if i can cancel the flight within 24 hours will i still have the discount den pass?`

**Failures:** 11 times

**Test Names:** `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_2`


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: If you received a Discount Den membership as part of a promotion when booking a flight, and you cancel that flight within 24 hours, the status of your Discount Den membership may depend on the specific terms of the promotion. Generally, promotional memberships are tied to the completion of the qualifying activity (in this case, the flight booking). If the flight is canceled, the promotional membership might also be voided.

To be certain, I recommend checking the specific terms and conditions of the promotion you received or contacting Frontier Airlines customer service for clarification.

Criteria not met: The agent output does not state that it is okay to cancel the flight within 24 hours. It only says the Discount Den membership "may depend" on the promotion and "might also be voided," and recommends checking terms or contacting customer service. Therefore it does not meet the criteria that the output says it's okay to cancel within 24 hours.
