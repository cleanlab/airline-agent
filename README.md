#### 🔍 Additional Test Failure Details

##### `If both of my small bags fit completely under the seat in front of me without taking any extra space, that counts as one personal item, correct?`

**Failures:** 28 times

**Test Names:** `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_3`


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: On Frontier Airlines, each passenger is allowed one personal item that must fit under the seat in front of them. This personal item can be a purse, backpack, or similar item. If you have two small bags, each would typically count as a separate item. Therefore, even if both bags fit under the seat, they would still be considered two separate personal items, not one. You would need to consolidate them into one bag to count as a single personal item.

Criteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that two small bags would typically count as two separate personal items and not as one, and advises consolidating them to count as a single personal item. This does not confirm that both small bags count as one personal item, so it fails the criterion.

##### `i saw your promo of a free discount den pass no enrollment fee and no annual fee with any accrual activity. i received the discount den after booking a flight. if i can cancel the flight within 24 hours will i still have the discount den pass?`

**Failures:** 10 times

<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: If you received a Discount Den membership as part of a promotion when booking a flight, and you cancel that flight within 24 hours, the status of your Discount Den membership may depend on the specific terms of the promotion. Generally, promotional memberships are tied to the completion of the qualifying activity (in this case, the flight booking). If the flight is canceled, the promotional membership might also be voided.

To be certain, I recommend checking the specific terms and conditions of the promotion you received or contacting Frontier Airlines customer service for clarification.

Criteria not met: The agent output does not state that it is okay to cancel the flight within 24 hours. Instead, it says the Discount Den membership status may depend on promotion terms and might be voided, and advises checking terms or contacting customer service. Therefore it does not meet the criterion.
