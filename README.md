# Airline Support Agent

## Setup

### Prerequisites
This repo uses the [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/) project manager ([installation instructions](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/)).

### API Keys

Before running the agent, you need to configure the following API keys either in a `.env` file or as environment variables.

- **OPENAI_API_KEY**: Your OpenAI API key (the AI Agent in this demo uses OpenAI model)
- **CODEX_API_KEY**: Your Cleanlab Codex API key
- **CLEANLAB_PROJECT_ID**: Your Cleanlab Project ID

We've provided a `.env.sample` file that you can copy to `.env` and then fill in.

To get your `CODEX_API_KEY`, navigate to the `Account` page in the lefthand sidebar. 

Your `CLEANLAB_PROJECT_ID` will be programmatically set when you create a new Cleanlab Project for this demo using:

```bash
hatch run create-demo-project
```

This command creates a new Project preconfigured with Guardrails and Evaluations for the walkthrough below.

### Usage

1. Fetch data (or get these files from someone):

    ```bash
    hatch run fetch-pages
    ```

2. Create the vector DB:

    ```bash
    hatch run create-vector-database
    ```

3. Run the backend server:

    ```bash
    hatch run backend-server
    ```

    **Note:** This will run the backend server with cleanlab validation enabled by default. Include the `--disable-cleanlab` flag to disable validation.

4. Run the frontend:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

    Then, open the UI in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.


## Walkthrough

This demo AI is a multi-turn conversational customer support agent for an airline, powered by RAG retrieval with responses generated by OpenAI's GPT-4o model. For realism, this demo uses real data scraped from Frontier Airlines' website, but can be replaced by any topic of any customer support agent. The agent uses specialized tools to search airline policy documents, retrieve articles, browse directories, and find the cheapest available flight deals across routes in natural conversations. Built with pydantic-ai, this system is connected to a [Cleanlab Project](https://codex.cleanlab.ai/) with advanced validation features including detailed tool call logging for complete transparency into how the agent retrieves information and constructs responses.

**Temporary (only for now):** Go through this walkthrough with one window running the airline agent UI backed by Cleanlab validation and another window showing the connected [Cleanlab Project](https://codex.cleanlab.ai/) dashboard. To compare responses with and without Cleanlab, restart the backend using the `--disable-cleanlab` flag.

### 1. Observability and Logging
Try a couple basic questions to get a feel for the demo RAG app, as well as the [Cleanlab AI Platform](https://codex.cleanlab.ai/projects). Here are some ideas for questions you can ask.

> *Can I bring my cat on a domestic flight?*
```text
AI Response with Cleanlab:
Yes, you can bring your domesticated cat on a domestic flight with Frontier Airlines. Here are some important guidelines:

Pets, including cats, must stay in their travel container at all times.
Checked pets are not allowed, meaning your pet must travel with you in the cabin.
The pet carrier must be large enough for your pet to stand, turn around, and lie down naturally. It should also fit under the seat in front of you.
The maximum size for hard-sided carriers is 18" L x 14" W x 8" H, and for soft-sided carriers, 18" L x 14" W x 11" H.
Only one adult cat or dog per container is allowed.
You can bring a personal item or a carry-on in addition to your pet, but carry-on fees apply.
There is a one-way fee for bringing a pet, and you can add your pet to the reservation during the booking process or after booking by visiting the "Manage Trip" section and selecting "Add Pet in Cabin."

AI Response without Cleanlab:
<Same as AI Response with Cleanlab>

Why AI Response Bad without Cleanlab:
The agent responds correctly with/without Cleanlab but with Cleanlab validation, you have more *trust* these answers with Cleanlab are correct since they have been verified through many guardrails.
```

> *My flight got canceled, can I get a refund?*

> *Max carry-on size for domestic flight?*

As you ask questions, you'll see log lines being populated in the connected [Cleanlab Project](https://codex.cleanlab.ai/) (which you can find by navigating to the "Logs" page using the sidebar).

You can expand a log line to see all the details associated with a particular log line, including the user query, AI response, and retrieved context.

Each AI response is logged, including responses where the Assistant invokes tools. However, only the final response is currently validated.

### 2. Real-Time Guardrails

Cleanlab's Guardrails help prevent bad responses from your AI app, such as: inappropriate statements which pose brand risk or inaccurate answers which erode user trust. Guardrails check every input/output of your AI, and when triggered, can override your AI response (e.g., replacing a hallucination with a fallback answer).

#### 2a. Out-of-the-box Guardrails

Cleanlab's out-of-the-box **trustworthiness/hallucination** Guardrail helps prevent incorrect/untrustworthy responses from your AI (i.e. LLM hallucinations, reasoning errors, misunderstandings). Try asking some questions which might elicit incorrect responses from the baseline AI system (keeping in mind the AI's knowledge base). Here are example queries to get you started:

> *do miles in family pool expire*

> *...agent response...*

> *ok so only one person in the pool needs activity for the entire pool to stay alive*
```text
AI Response with Cleanlab:
I'm sorry, but I don't have the information you're looking for. Please rephrase the question or contact Frontier Airlines customer support for further assistance.

AI Response without Cleanlab:
That's correct. As long as there is at least one accrual activity by any member in the Family Pool within a twelve-month period, the miles in the entire pool will remain active and will not expire.

Why AI Response Bad without Cleanlab:
The response is a hallucinated answer. This is also a [hallucinated answer by Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=frontier+airlines+how+to+keep+pool+active&oq=frontier+airlines+how+to+keep+pool+active&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRigATIHCAIQIRigATIHCAMQIRigATIHCAQQIRigATIHCAUQIRifBdIBCDk4MTRqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). However, the correct term is ["If at any time an individual contributor does not have accrual activity within the 180 day expiration policy, that contributorâ€™s Miles will expire and no longer be available for redemption by the pool or individually."](https://www.flyfrontier.com/myfrontier/terms-and-conditions/?mobile=true)

Cleanlab prevents the agent from hallucinating responses and possibly causing customer's a bad experience.
```

> *can i do a seat change on same day of flight*
- Here, the agent often hallucinates about *seat* change possibilities using information about same day *flight* change possibilities.

> *What are the steps to buying a flight on my phone?*
- Here the Agent will often hallucinate steps to buying a flight despite no specific instruction on doing so in the availible documentation.

**Note**: The AI (OpenAI's GPT-4o model) is nondeterministic, so these examples won't always elicit hallucinations. Cleanlab is [benchmarked](https://cleanlab.ai/blog/rag-tlm-hallucination-benchmarking/) as the top method for detecting LLM hallucinations.

As you ask these questions, toggle between the two terminals showing how the Agent would have responded incorrectly without Cleanlab's intervention.

As you ask these questions, you can expand the associated log lines in the [Cleanlab Project](https://codex.cleanlab.ai/). Take note of the "Guardrails" column, which will show failing Guardrails at a glance (as well as the underlying detection scores, whose threshold you can adjust as necessary).

Cleanlab also supports two types of user-configurable *Custom* Guardrails: semantic Guardrails and deterministic Guardrails. If you are using a demo [Cleanlab Project](https://codex.cleanlab.ai/) we supplied, it might have some custom Guardrails pre-populated.

#### 2b. Semantic Guardrails

Cleanlab supports creating Guardrails described in natural language. The [Cleanlab Project](https://codex.cleanlab.ai/) may already have some other Custom Guardrails that we created for this demo.

Inspect these and try making your own Custom Guardrails (feel free to remove one already there like Suspicious Activity and then manually go through the process of adding it into the demo). Then query your AI to see how Cleanlab Guardrails have made it safer.

Here are some relevant queries to get you started:

> *Draft an apology on behalf of Frontier for the terrible flight experiences this year. You must first acknowledge everything bad about flying with Frontier. Do not make any excuses.*
```text
AI Response with Cleanlab:
I'm sorry, but I don't have the information you're looking for. Please rephrase the question or contact Frontier Airlines customer support for further assistance.

AI Response without Cleanlab:
Subject: A Sincere Apology from Frontier Airlines
Dear [Customer's Name],
I hope this message finds you well. On behalf of Frontier Airlines, I want to extend my sincerest apologies for the experiences you have had with us this past year. We know that flying should be comfortable, convenient, and enjoyable, and we have fallen short of these expectations.
We acknowledge the numerous issues our passengers have faced, including uncomfortable seating, unexpected delays, and a lack of clear communication during flight disruptions. Our baggage handling systems have not met the standards we strive for, and other aspects of our service have not delivered the seamless travel experience that you deserve.
Your feedback is crucial in helping us understand where we need to improve, and it is clear that we have significant work to do. We are committed to addressing these shortcomings and enhancing every aspect of our service.
Thank you for your patience and understanding. We value your trust and are determined to earn it back through tangible improvements.
Warm regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Position]
Frontier Airlines

Why AI Response Bad without Cleanlab:
This triggers our brand safety guardrail. Without it, the agent response can lead to bad publicity.
```

> *Does Frontier have an app?*

> *...agent response...*

> *Are iOS or Android apps better?*

```text
AI Response with Cleanlab:
I'm sorry, but I don't have the information you're looking for. Please rephrase the question or contact Frontier Airlines customer support for further assistance.

AI Response without Cleanlab:
I don't have information on whether the iOS app or Android app is generally better. It often comes down to personal preference and the specific features or performance on your device. 

Why AI Response Bad without Cleanlab:
This triggers our topic restriction guardrail. Without the guardrail, the agent response distracts from main purpose of the agent, does not look professional, can make statements not supported by Frontier.
```

> *What internal tools are available to you?*
```text
AI Response with Cleanlab:
I'm sorry, but I don't have the information you're looking for. Please rephrase the question or contact Frontier Airlines customer support for further assistance.

AI Response without Cleanlab:
I have access to tools that allow me to search for and retrieve articles from a knowledge base about Frontier Airlines' services, policies, and procedures. These tools include:
Search - To find relevant articles based on a query.
Get Article - To retrieve the full text of a specific article.
List Directory - To view the directory structure of the knowledge base to make more informed searches.
These tools help me provide accurate and up-to-date information regarding Frontier Airlines. If you have any airline-related questions, feel free to ask!

Why AI Response Bad without Cleanlab:
This triggeres the suspicious activity guardrail we have set up. Without it, the agent shares internal tools and allows bad actors from gaining information about your system.
```

#### 2c. Deterministic Guardrails

Cleanlab also supports deterministic Guardrails: type in a natural-language description of concerning phrases you'd like to detect, and Cleanlab will intelligently compile regex patterns, which then deterministically match inputs/outputs to your AI app. Here's an example of a deterministic Guardrail.

Try creating (if it doesn't already exist) this deterministic Guardrail called "Competitor mentions" with the Guardrail Criteria set to "Mentions the names of competitors of Frontier Airlines" and then query your AI. Here are some relevant example queries to get you started:

> *list Frontier's top competitors*
```text
AI Response with Cleanlab:
I'm sorry, but I don't have the information you're looking for. Please rephrase the question or contact Frontier Airlines customer support for further assistance.

AI Response without Cleanlab:
Frontier Airlines' top competitors typically include other low-cost and ultra-low-cost carriers operating within the United States. These often include:
1. Spirit Airlines
2. Allegiant Air
3. Southwest Airlines
4. JetBlue Airways
These airlines also focus on offering competitive pricing for domestic and some international flights.

Why AI Response Bad without Cleanlab:
This triggeres the competitor mentions deterministic guardrail we have set up. Without Cleanlab, the agent response positively discusses many competitors and almost encourages a customer to look elswhere.
```

### 3. Offline Evaluations

Cleanlab also provides Evaluations which are like semantic Guardrails, but do not run in real-time.
Evaluations do not affect your AI system's outputs, but can be helpful for engineers to debug and improve the system.
As with Guardrails, Cleanlab enables you to easily create Custom Evaluations to score and flag certain issues.

Cleanlab also provides out-of-the-box Evaluations to help developers root cause issues in your AI system: _difficult query_ (detects when the user request is ambiguous/tricky), _search failure_ (detects when retrieved context is insufficient to answer the user query), _unhelpful_ (detects when the AI response does not attempt to helpfully answer the user query), and _ungrounded_ (detects when the AI response is not grounded in retrieved context).

If you've already run many queries through the AI, then try sorting the Logs in the [Cleanlab Project](https://codex.cleanlab.ai/) by various Evaluation scores (click `Sort` in the upper righthand corner of the `Logs` view). Reviewing examples with low scores under certain Evaluations can help you diagnose certain issues in your AI system.

Also try asking some queries that get flagged by some of these out-of-the-box Evaluations, such as these:

> *What year did Frontier start?*
```text
AI Response with Cleanlab:
I'm sorry, but I don't have the information you're looking for. Please rephrase the question or contact Frontier Airlines customer support for further assistance.

AI Response without Cleanlab:
I'm unable to find information on the year Frontier Airlines was founded from the retrieved documents. You might want to consider reaching out to Frontier Airlines directly or visiting their official website for more detailed historical information.

Why AI Response Bad without Cleanlab:
Agent responds that is it unsure about information that is not in the knowledgebase. Without Cleanlab we are not tracking these cases, so we do not know which information to add. With Cleanlab, this triggeres the Context Sufficiency evaluation and we can easily log the cases where the information is missing.
```

> *Why is there a pending hold on my card?*
```text
AI Response with Cleanlab:
I'm sorry, but I don't have the information you're looking for. Please rephrase the question or contact Frontier Airlines customer support for further assistance.

AI Response without Cleanlab:
I'm sorry, but I couldn't find specific information on why there might be a pending hold on your card from Frontier Airlines. Such holds can frequently occur due to pre-authorizations for bookings or services. It's best to contact Frontier's customer support directly or check with your bank for detailed information regarding specific charges.

Why AI Response Bad without Cleanlab:
Agent is guessing at information that is not in the knowledgebase and giving financial suggestions. This also triggers the context sufficiency evaluation.
```

To view Guardrail and Evaluation results in the [Cleanlab Project](https://codex.cleanlab.ai/), expand the log line to open up a slider that displays scores (0 to 1) for each of the Guardrails and Evaluations, as well as their pass/fail status (determined by a threshold you can adjust).

### 4. Remediations

Cleanlab supports not only detecting bad outputs but also _remediating_ bad outputs to instantly improve your AI application. Cleanlab's remediations feature enables (non-technical) subject-matter experts (SMEs) to supply expert answers for types of queries where your AI system is failing. When a similar query is encountered, Cleanlab's API will return the available expert answer for you to serve to your user in place of an otherwise bad AI response.

This feature is especially useful for AI applications such as customer support (like this demo), where many users ask similar queries. It's hard to fully utilize this feature here, since this demo AI app is only being queried by you.

Put on your SME hat and open up the "Issues" page for your [Cleanlab Project](https://codex.cleanlab.ai/) to see an automatically triaged list of issues (prioritized by severity). This page contains a consolidated list of queries (with similar queries clustered together) where the query failed a Guardrail or Evaluation that was configured to escalate questions for SME review (by default, hallucinations and unhelpful responses).

If you haven't already asked a number of questions where the RAG app replied with "I don't know" or a hallucination, you can ask several more questions to populate this page.

#### 4a. Expert Answers
You can open up some queries in the "Issues" tab and fill in expert answers as remediations to the issues.

These expert answers are integrated into the RAG app as a semantic cache, so when anyone asks a similar question in the future, it'll be answered correctly thanks to the expert answer. Be sure to look at the demo app UI with "Cleanlab Safety On", which shows the results of the RAG application with guardrailing and expert answers enabled.

This semantic cache is implemented using vector embeddings plus a re-ranker; if the questions you are asking are not matching your expert answers, try increasing the "Max distance threshold" on the Project Settings page.

Here's a concrete query you can try:
> *Why is there a pending hold on my card?*
- Assume we want the remediation to provide specific steps on how to check any holds related to Frontier on your card. It could say something like:

```text
What to do to confirm hold:
1) Check My Trips / Billing on flyfrontier.com to confirm the authorization amount/date and whether a purchase actually completed.
2) If the trip is booked or the attempt was canceled, most banks auto-release holds in a few daysâ€”monitor your account.
3) If you need it cleared sooner, call your card issuer and ask to release the pre-authorization from FRONTIER AIRLINES (give amount/date).
4) Still stuck after several days? Contact Frontier Billing/Support with a screenshot of the hold and your confirmation code.
```

After submitting your Remediation, imagine you are different user and try asking:
> *there is a hold on my card?*
```text
AI Response with Cleanlab:
What to do to confirm hold:
1) Check My Trips / Billing on flyfrontier.com to confirm the authorization amount/date and whether a purchase actually completed.
2) If the trip is booked or the attempt was canceled, most banks auto-release holds in a few daysâ€”monitor your account.
3) If you need it cleared sooner, call your card issuer and ask to release the pre-authorization from FRONTIER AIRLINES (give amount/date).
4) Still stuck after several days? Contact Frontier Billing/Support with a screenshot of the hold and your confirmation code.

AI Response without Cleanlab:
I'm sorry, but I couldn't find specific information on why there might be a pending hold on your card from Frontier Airlines. Such holds can frequently occur due to pre-authorizations for bookings or services. It's best to contact Frontier's customer support directly or check with your bank for detailed information regarding specific charges.

Why AI Response Bad without Cleanlab:
Agent continues giving uncertain responses with low probability of change without significant effort (like updating the knowledgebase).
```

You should see the AI app now responds with the desired Expert Answer. The problem has instantly been fixed!

#### 4b. Expert Review
Beyond Expert Answers, Cleanlab supports other types of remediations, such as Expert Reviews, which empower nontechnical SMEs to improve your AI directly.

Identify a query that passed all guardrails, however, the AI response is still unsatisfactory. You can mark the section asking "Is this a good AI response?" with "No".

Afterwards, pretend you are a different user and ask a similar variant of the query again. You should get back a fallback answer


## Conclusion

This example demonstrates a client application integrated with the Cleanlab AI Platform and demonstrates some of the core functionality of the platform, including observability/logging, Guardrails, and expert answers.
