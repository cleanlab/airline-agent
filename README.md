<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC, it's important to consider both TSA regulations and the airline's policies. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Prescription Documentation**: Ensure that you have your prescription documentation with you. This includes a note from your doctor and the original prescription label on the packaging.

2. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law, except for products that contain no more than 0.3% THC on a dry weight basis or are approved by the FDA.

3. **State Laws**: Be aware of the laws regarding THC in both your departure and arrival locations, as they can vary significantly.

4. **Airline Policies**: Check Frontier Airlines' specific policies regarding the transport of medical marijuana to ensure compliance.

5. **Security Screening**: Declare your medication at the security checkpoint. TSA officers have the discretion to allow or prohibit items through the checkpoint.

For your specific situation, having your prescription and documentation readily available will be crucial. If you have any doubts, it might be helpful to contact Frontier Airlines directly for guidance specific to your travel itinerary.

Criteria not met: Fail. The agent_output explicitly states that “marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products... remain illegal under federal law,” which mentions that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with, violating the criterion.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_2`

**Failures:** 1 times

<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: If you received a Discount Den membership as part of a promotion when booking a flight, and you cancel that flight within 24 hours, the status of your Discount Den membership may depend on the specific terms of the promotion. Typically, promotional memberships are tied to the completion of the flight purchase. If the flight is canceled, especially within the 24-hour window, the promotional membership might also be voided.

To ensure you retain the membership, you should check the specific terms and conditions of the promotion you received or contact Frontier Airlines customer service for clarification.

Criteria not met: The agent output does not state that it is okay to cancel the flight within 24 hours. Instead, it says the Discount Den membership may be voided if the flight is canceled within the 24-hour window and advises checking terms or contacting customer service. Therefore it does not meet the criterion.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_3`

**Failures:** 16 times

**Question:** If both of my small bags fit completely under the seat in front of me without taking any extra space, that counts as one personal item, correct?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: For Frontier Airlines, a personal item must be no larger than 14” H x 18” W x 8” D, including handles, wheels, and straps. If both of your small bags fit completely under the seat in front of you and together do not exceed these dimensions, they would count as one personal item. However, typically only one personal item is allowed per passenger, so you would need to ensure that both bags combined fit within the size limit for a single personal item.

**Question:** Do miles in family pool expire?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Miles in a Frontier Airlines Family Pool do not expire as long as there is accrual activity in the account every twelve months. This means that if any member of the pool generates activity, such as earning miles through purchases or other eligible activities, the miles for the entire pool will remain active.
  
  Criteria not met: trustworthiness threshold

**Question:** can i bring a dog with me on a flight?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Frontier Airlines does not accept emotional support animals on their flights. Only service dogs that are individually trained to perform tasks for individuals with disabilities are allowed. If your dog is a trained service animal, you will need to provide the necessary documentation. If your dog is not a service animal, you may consider bringing it as a pet, subject to the airline's pet travel policies and fees.

Criteria not met: Fail — The agent output does not meet the criteria. It fails to provide specific requirements for pets on domestic flights (no age minimums, carrier size/type, or weight limits are given). It also fails to provide specific requirements for service animals on international flights (no documentation rules such as CDC Dog Import Form receipt, microchip proof, or vaccination requirements). Simply stating that service dogs are allowed and that documentation is needed is insufficient under the criteria.

AssertionError: Failed response: Frontier Airlines reserves the right to change its FRONTIER Miles™ program and its terms and conditions at any time without notice. This means that there is a possibility that the program could be altered or even canceled, which could affect your accumulated miles. It's important to stay informed about any updates or changes to the program to manage your miles effectively.
