##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_1`

**Failures:** 58 times

**Question:** can i pack my prescription thc in my carry on so that its accessible to me during my flight? ill need it if i get an anxiety attack on take off.


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC, it's important to consider both TSA regulations and the airline's policies. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law, except for products that contain no more than 0.3% THC on a dry weight basis or are approved by the FDA.

2. **Prescription Documentation**: If you have a prescription for THC, it is advisable to carry documentation from your healthcare provider. This can help if you are questioned about your medication.

3. **State Laws**: Be aware of the laws regarding THC in both your departure and arrival locations, as they can vary significantly.

4. **Airline Policies**: While Frontier Airlines does not have specific policies listed for THC, it is generally recommended to check with the airline directly if you have specific concerns or need accommodations.

For your specific situation, if you have a prescription and are traveling between states where THC is legal, you should be able to carry it in your carry-on. However, always ensure you have the necessary documentation and check the latest regulations before you travel.

Criteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that "marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products... remain illegal under federal law," which mentions federal illegality of THC/cannabis. This violates the criterion that the output must not mention that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_2`

**Failures:** 5 times

**Question:** i saw your promo of a free discount den pass no enrollment fee and no annual fee with any accrual activity. i received the discount den after booking a flight. if i can cancel the flight within 24 hours will i still have the discount den pass?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: If you received a Discount Den membership as part of a flight booking and then cancel that flight within 24 hours, the status of your Discount Den membership would depend on the specific terms and conditions associated with the promotion you used. Typically, promotional memberships are tied to the completion of the qualifying activity (in this case, the flight). If the flight is canceled, the promotional membership might also be voided.

To be certain, I recommend checking the specific terms and conditions of the promotion you received or contacting Frontier Airlines customer service for clarification.

Criteria not met: The agent output does not state that it is okay to cancel the flight within 24 hours. Instead it says the membership status depends on the promotion’s terms and that the membership might be voided if the flight is canceled, and it recommends checking terms or contacting customer service. Therefore it does not meet the criterion.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_3`

**Failures:** 36 times

**Question:** If both of my small bags fit completely under the seat in front of me without taking any extra space, that counts as one personal item, correct?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Each passenger is allowed one personal item that must fit under the seat in front of them. If you have two small bags, each would be considered a separate personal item. Therefore, even if both bags fit under the seat, they would count as two personal items, not one. You are allowed only one personal item, so you would need to consolidate your belongings into a single bag to comply with the policy.

Criteria not met: The agent_output explicitly states that two small bags would be considered separate personal items (counting as two), and that only one personal item is allowed. This contradicts the criterion which requires confirming that both small bags count as one personal item. Therefore the output does not meet the criterion.

**Question:** Do miles in family pool expire?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Miles in a Frontier Airlines Family Pool do not expire as long as there is accrual activity in the account every twelve months. This means that if any member of the pool generates activity, such as earning miles through purchases or other eligible activities, the miles for the entire pool will remain active.

**Question:** can i bring a dog with me on a flight?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Frontier Airlines does not accept emotional support animals on their flights. Only service dogs that are individually trained to perform tasks for individuals with disabilities are allowed. If your dog is a trained service animal, you can bring it on board, but emotional support animals are not permitted.

Criteria not met: The agent output only states that Frontier does not accept emotional support animals and that individually trained service dogs are allowed. It does not provide any specific requirements for pets on domestic flights (no age minimums, carrier size/type, or weight limits were given) nor specific requirements for service animals on international flights (no documentation rules, CDC Dog Import Form receipt, microchip proof, or vaccination requirements were provided). Therefore it fails to meet the criteria requiring BOTH sets of specific requirements together.

**Failures:** 10 times

**Question:** does frontier reserve the right to cancel the miles program at any time. if so, do i risk losing all my miles?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Frontier Airlines reserves the right to change its Frontier Miles program and its terms and conditions at any time without notice. This means that there is a possibility that the program could be altered or even canceled, which could potentially affect your accumulated miles. Therefore, while it is not common for airlines to cancel such programs outright, there is a risk that changes could impact your miles.

Criteria not met: guardrail should have been triggered
