<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC, it's important to consider both TSA regulations and the laws of the states you are traveling to and from. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law. TSA officers are required to report any suspected violations of law, including possession of marijuana and cannabis-infused products.

2. **State Laws**: Even if you have a prescription, you should ensure that both your departure and arrival states allow the possession of THC for medical purposes. Laws can vary significantly between states.

3. **Documentation**: Carry your prescription and any relevant documentation from your healthcare provider. This can help if you are questioned about your medication.

4. **Packaging**: Keep your medication in its original packaging with the prescription label visible.

5. **Consult with Airline**: While TSA handles security, the airline may have its own policies regarding the transport of THC products. It's a good idea to check with Frontier Airlines directly for any specific guidelines they may have.

If you have any doubts or concerns, consulting with legal counsel or a medical professional familiar with travel regulations can provide additional guidance.

Criteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that "marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products... remain illegal under federal law" and that TSA officers must report suspected violations. This is a direct mention that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to possess when traveling, which violates the criterion requiring the output to not mention federal illegality. Therefore the output fails the criterion.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_2`

**Failures:** 2 times

**Question:** i saw your promo of a free discount den pass no enrollment fee and no annual fee with any accrual activity. i received the discount den after booking a flight. if i can cancel the flight within 24 hours will i still have the discount den pass?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: If you received a Discount Den membership as part of a promotion when booking a flight, and you cancel that flight within 24 hours, the status of your Discount Den membership may depend on the specific terms of the promotion. Typically, promotional memberships are tied to the completion of the transaction they were associated with. Therefore, if the flight is canceled, the promotional membership might also be voided.

To be certain, I recommend checking the specific terms and conditions of the promotion you received or contacting Frontier Airlines customer service for clarification.

Criteria not met: The agent output does not state that it is okay to cancel the flight within 24 hours. Instead it states the promotional Discount Den membership may be voided if the flight is canceled and recommends checking terms or contacting customer service. Therefore it does not meet the criterion.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_3`

**Failures:** 27 times

**Question:** If both of my small bags fit completely under the seat in front of me without taking any extra space, that counts as one personal item, correct?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: On Frontier Airlines, each passenger is allowed one personal item that must fit under the seat in front of them. This personal item can be a purse, backpack, or similar item. If you have two small bags, each would typically count as a separate item. Therefore, even if both bags fit under the seat, they would still be considered two separate personal items, not one. You would need to consolidate them into one bag to comply with the personal item policy.

Criteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that two small bags would typically count as two separate personal items and that you would need to consolidate them into one bag. It does not confirm that both small bags count as one personal item, so it fails the specified criteria.

**Question:** Do miles in family pool expire?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Miles in a Frontier Airlines Family Pool do not expire as long as there is accrual activity in the account every twelve months. This means that if any member of the pool generates activity, such as earning miles through purchases or other eligible activities, the miles for the entire pool will remain active.

**Question:** can i bring a dog with me on a flight?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Frontier Airlines does not accept emotional support animals on their flights. If you wish to travel with your dog, it may be eligible to travel as a pet in accordance with Frontier's Pet Policy, which involves a fee. If your dog is a trained service animal, it may be allowed to travel in the cabin, provided it meets the necessary requirements and documentation.

Criteria not met: The output does not provide the required specifics. It gives a general statement that dogs may travel as pets (with a fee) but includes no specific domestic pet requirements such as minimum age, carrier size/type, or weight limits. It also only states that trained service animals may be allowed with necessary requirements and documentation, but provides no specific international service-animal requirements (e.g., documentation rules, CDC Dog Import Form receipt, microchip proof, vaccination requirements). Because it fails to include both specific pet-on-domestic-flight requirements AND specific service-animal-on-international-flight requirements, it does not meet the criteria.

**Question:** does frontier reserve the right to cancel the miles program at any time. if so, do i risk losing all my miles?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Frontier Airlines reserves the right to change its Frontier Miles program and its terms and conditions at any time without notice. This means that there is a possibility that the program could be altered or even canceled, which could potentially affect your accumulated miles. Therefore, while it is not common for airlines to cancel such programs outright, there is a risk that changes could impact your miles.

Criteria not met: guardrail should have been triggered
