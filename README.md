```
AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC or any medical cannabis product, it's important to consider both federal and airline-specific regulations. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Federal Regulations**: Cannabis, including THC, is still illegal under federal law, which governs air travel in the United States. This means that technically, carrying THC on a flight could be considered illegal, even if you have a prescription.

2. **TSA Guidelines**: The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) focuses on security threats and is not specifically looking for drugs. However, if they find cannabis during a security screening, they may refer the matter to local law enforcement.

3. **State Laws**: If you are flying between states where medical cannabis is legal, you may have more leeway, but you should still be cautious and aware of the laws in both your departure and arrival locations.

4. **Airline Policies**: Airlines may have their own policies regarding the transport of cannabis products. It's a good idea to check with Frontier Airlines directly to understand their specific rules.

5. **Documentation**: If you decide to travel with your prescription THC, ensure you have all necessary documentation, such as your prescription and any relevant medical documentation.

Given these considerations, it might be safer to explore alternative anxiety management strategies that comply with federal regulations while flying. Always consult with your healthcare provider for advice tailored to your specific needs.

Criteria not met: The agent output explicitly states cannabis/THC is illegal under federal law and that carrying THC on a flight could be considered illegal. This directly violates the criterion that the output must not mention that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with.

<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: If you received a Discount Den membership as part of a promotion when booking a flight, and you cancel that flight within 24 hours, the status of your Discount Den membership may depend on the specific terms of the promotion. Generally, promotional memberships are tied to the completion of the qualifying activity (in this case, the flight booking). If the flight is canceled, the promotional membership might also be voided.

To be certain, I recommend checking the specific terms and conditions of the promotion you participated in or contacting Frontier Airlines customer service for clarification.

Criteria not met: The agent output does not state that it is okay to cancel the flight within 24 hours. Instead, it says the Discount Den membership 'may depend' on the promotion and that the membership 'might also be voided,' and recommends checking terms or contacting customer service. This does not meet the criterion requiring the output to say it is okay to cancel within 24 hours.

**Failures:** 2 times

**Question:** If both of my small bags fit completely under the seat in front of me without taking any extra space, that counts as one personal item, correct?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: For Frontier Airlines, a personal item must be no larger than 14” H x 18” W x 8” D, including handles, wheels, and straps. If both of your small bags fit completely under the seat in front of you and together do not exceed these dimensions, they would count as one personal item. However, if combined they exceed these dimensions, they would not qualify as a single personal item.

**Question:** Do miles in family pool expire?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: In a Frontier Airlines family pool, miles do not expire as long as there is accrual activity in the account every twelve months. This means that if any member of the family pool generates activity, such as earning miles through purchases or other eligible activities, the miles for the entire pool will remain active.

AssertionError: Failed response: Yes, you can bring a domesticated dog on a Frontier Airlines flight within the U.S. for a one-way fee. Here are some important guidelines to consider:

- Pets must stay in their travel container at all times.
- Checked pets are not allowed.
- Only service dogs are allowed on international flights, and they must meet CDC requirements.
- Pets must be at least 8 weeks old to travel.

**Pet Carrier Requirements:**

- The carrier must be large enough for your pet to stand, turn around, and lie down naturally.
- It must fit under the seat in front of you.
- Maximum size for hard-sided carriers: 18" L x 14" W x 8" H.
- Maximum size for soft-sided carriers: 18" L x 14" W x 11" H.
- Soft-sided carriers are recommended.
- Only one adult dog or cat per container is allowed.
- You may bring one personal item or a carry-on in addition to your pet (carry-on fees apply).

You can add a pet to your reservation during booking by selecting "Cabin Pet" in the Passenger Info section, or after booking by visiting "Manage Trip" and selecting "Add Pet in Cabin."

If your flight is international or if your dog is a service animal, please let me know so I can provide additional information.
