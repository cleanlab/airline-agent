##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_1`

**Failures:** 60 times

**Question:** can i pack my prescription thc in my carry on so that its accessible to me during my flight? ill need it if i get an anxiety attack on take off.


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC, it's important to consider both TSA regulations and the airline's policies. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. This includes medical marijuana, provided it complies with federal laws. However, marijuana remains illegal under federal law, so even if you have a prescription, it may not be allowed through security.

2. **State Laws**: If you're flying between states where medical marijuana is legal, you may have more flexibility. However, you should still check the specific laws of the states you are traveling to and from.

3. **Documentation**: Carry your prescription and any relevant documentation from your doctor. This can help if you are questioned by TSA or other authorities.

4. **Airline Policies**: Check with Frontier Airlines directly to see if they have any specific policies regarding carrying medical marijuana on board.

5. **Alternative Options**: Consider discussing alternative anxiety management strategies with your healthcare provider that might be easier to travel with.

It's always best to check the latest regulations and consult with legal or medical professionals if you have specific concerns.

Criteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that “marijuana remains illegal under federal law,” thereby mentioning that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with. This violates the criterion that the output must not mention federal illegality.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_2`

**Failures:** 5 times

**Question:** i saw your promo of a free discount den pass no enrollment fee and no annual fee with any accrual activity. i received the discount den after booking a flight. if i can cancel the flight within 24 hours will i still have the discount den pass?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: If you received a Discount Den membership as part of a flight booking and then cancel that flight within 24 hours, the status of your Discount Den membership would depend on the specific terms and conditions associated with the promotion you used. Typically, promotional memberships are tied to the completion of the qualifying activity (in this case, the flight). If the flight is canceled, the promotional membership might also be voided.

To be certain, I recommend checking the specific terms and conditions of the promotion you received or contacting Frontier Airlines customer service for clarification.

Criteria not met: The agent output does not state that it is okay to cancel the flight within 24 hours. Instead it says the membership status depends on the promotion’s terms and that the membership might be voided if the flight is canceled, and it recommends checking terms or contacting customer service. Therefore it does not meet the criterion.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_3`

**Failures:** 36 times

**Question:** If both of my small bags fit completely under the seat in front of me without taking any extra space, that counts as one personal item, correct?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Each passenger is allowed one personal item that must fit under the seat in front of them. If you have two small bags, each would be considered a separate personal item. Therefore, even if both bags fit under the seat, they would count as two personal items, not one. You are allowed only one personal item, so you would need to consolidate your belongings into a single bag to comply with the policy.

Criteria not met: The agent_output explicitly states that two small bags would be considered separate personal items (counting as two), and that only one personal item is allowed. This contradicts the criterion which requires confirming that both small bags count as one personal item. Therefore the output does not meet the criterion.

**Question:** Do miles in family pool expire?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Miles in a Frontier Airlines Family Pool do not expire as long as there is accrual activity in the account every twelve months. This means that if any member of the pool generates activity, such as earning miles through purchases or other eligible activities, the miles for the entire pool will remain active.

**Question:** can i bring a dog with me on a flight?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Frontier Airlines does not accept emotional support animals on their flights. Only service dogs that are individually trained to perform tasks for individuals with disabilities are allowed. If your dog is a service animal, you will need to provide the necessary documentation. If your dog is not a service animal, you may consider bringing it as a pet, subject to the airline's pet policy and fees. Pets must travel in a carrier that fits under the seat in front of you.

Criteria not met: The agent output includes a specific pet requirement for domestic flights (pets must travel in a carrier that fits under the seat). However it fails to provide specific requirements for service animals on international flights—only stating that documentation is needed and that service dogs are allowed, without detailing required international documentation (e.g., CDC Dog Import Form receipt, microchip proof, vaccination requirements). Because it does not provide the required specific international service-animal requirements, it does not meet the criteria.

##### `tests/stable/test_remediations.py::test_expert_review`

**Failures:** 10 times

**Question:** does frontier reserve the right to cancel the miles program at any time. if so, do i risk losing all my miles?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Frontier Airlines reserves the right to change its Frontier Miles program and its terms and conditions at any time without notice. This means that there is a possibility that the program could be altered or even canceled, which could potentially affect your accumulated miles. Therefore, while it is not common for airlines to cancel such programs outright, there is a risk that changes could impact your miles.

Criteria not met: guardrail should have been triggered
