AssertionError: Failed response: Miles in a Frontier Airlines Family Pool do not expire as long as there is accrual activity in the account every twelve months. This means that if any member of the pool generates activity, such as earning miles through purchases or other eligible activities, the miles for the entire pool will remain active.

AssertionError: Failed response: Frontier Airlines reserves the right to change its Frontier Miles program and its terms and conditions at any time without notice. This means that there is a possibility that the program could be altered or even canceled, which could potentially affect your accumulated miles. Therefore, there is a risk of losing your miles if the program is discontinued or if the terms change in a way that impacts your ability to use them.

Criteria not met: guardrail should have been triggered

AssertionError: Failed response: Frontier Airlines is currently running a "Kids Fly Free" promotion. Here are the key details:

- **Eligibility**: This offer is available to members of the Discount Den travel club. Kids aged 14 and under can fly for free on select flights when accompanied by an adult who has purchased a Discount Den fare.
- **Booking Requirements**: The promotion is valid for bookings made on Frontier's website, flyfrontier.com. It applies to select round-trip domestic flights within the continental United States.
- **Travel Dates**: The offer is valid for travel on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, with certain blackout dates including November 25-26, 2025, and December 23-24, 30-31, 2025.
- **Limitations**: The offer cannot be combined with other promotions or discounts, and it does not include additional services like baggage or seat assignments. Kids flying free do not earn Frontier Miles.
- **Membership**: To access this offer, you must be a Discount Den member, which costs $59.99 annually, with a $40 enrollment fee for new or returning members.

This promotion provides a great opportunity for families to save on travel costs. If you're interested, make sure to book your flights through Frontier's website and check for eligible flights marked with the Kids Fly Free logo.

Criteria not met: The criterion requires the output to state that information about the bogo promo is NOT available. The provided agent output instead gives detailed information about a 'Kids Fly Free' promotion and does not state that bogo promo information is unavailable. Therefore it does not meet the criterion.

AssertionError: Failed response: The earliest Frontier flight from New York City (JFK) to Oakland (OAK) on November 15, 2025, departs at 9:45 AM.

Criteria not met: The agent output explicitly identifies the earliest flight as departing from JFK ("New York City (JFK) to Oakland (OAK)"), which contradicts the criteria that the output must NOT identify the earliest flight as from EWR to OAK. Therefore it fails the criterion.

#### 🔍 Additional Test Failure Details

##### `If both of my small bags fit completely under the seat in front of me without taking any extra space, that counts as one personal item, correct?`

```
AssertionError: Failed response: For Frontier Airlines, a personal item must be no larger than 14” H x 18” W x 8” D, including handles, wheels, and straps. If both of your small bags fit completely under the seat in front of you and together do not exceed these dimensions, they would count as one personal item. However, if combined they exceed these dimensions, they would not qualify as a single personal item.

##### `i saw your promo of a free discount den pass no enrollment fee and no annual fee with any accrual activity. i received the discount den after booking a flight. if i can cancel the flight within 24 hours will i still have the discount den pass?`

**Failures:** 19 times

```
AssertionError: Failed response: If you received a Discount Den membership as part of a promotion when booking a flight, and you cancel that flight within 24 hours, the status of your Discount Den membership may depend on the specific terms of the promotion. Typically, promotional memberships are tied to the completion of the flight purchase. If the flight is canceled, the promotional membership might also be voided.

To ensure you retain your Discount Den membership, I recommend checking the specific terms and conditions of the promotion you received or contacting Frontier Airlines customer service for clarification.

Criteria not met: The provided output does not state that it is okay to cancel the flight within 24 hours. Instead it says the membership "may" be affected and "might" be voided and recommends checking terms or contacting customer service. Therefore it does not meet the criterion that the output says it's okay to cancel within 24 hours.
