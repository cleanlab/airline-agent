##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_1`

**Failures:** 57 times

**Question:** can i pack my prescription thc in my carry on so that its accessible to me during my flight? ill need it if i get an anxiety attack on take off.


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC or any medical cannabis products, it's important to consider both federal and airline-specific regulations. Here are some key points to keep in mind:

1. **Federal Regulations**: Cannabis, including THC, is still illegal under federal law in the United States. This includes both medical and recreational cannabis. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is a federal agency, and while they focus on security threats, they may refer any suspected violations of law to local, state, or federal authorities.

2. **State Laws**: If you are flying between states where medical cannabis is legal, you may have more flexibility. However, you should carry your prescription and any relevant documentation with you.

3. **Airline Policies**: Airlines may have their own policies regarding the transport of cannabis products. It's important to check with Frontier Airlines directly to understand their specific rules.

4. **Documentation**: Always carry your prescription and any documentation that proves your legal right to possess medical cannabis.

5. **Alternative Options**: If you're concerned about anxiety during the flight, consider discussing alternative medications or strategies with your healthcare provider that might be more straightforward to carry on a flight.

For the most accurate and personalized advice, it's best to contact Frontier Airlines directly and consult with your healthcare provider.

Criteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that cannabis/THC is illegal under federal law (point 1), which directly violates the criterion that the output must not mention that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with. Therefore the output fails the criterion.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_2`

**Failures:** 5 times

**Question:** i saw your promo of a free discount den pass no enrollment fee and no annual fee with any accrual activity. i received the discount den after booking a flight. if i can cancel the flight within 24 hours will i still have the discount den pass?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: If you received a Discount Den membership as part of a flight booking and then cancel that flight within 24 hours, the status of your Discount Den membership would depend on the specific terms and conditions associated with the promotion you used. Typically, promotional memberships are tied to the completion of the qualifying activity (in this case, the flight). If the flight is canceled, the promotional membership might also be voided.

To be certain, I recommend checking the specific terms and conditions of the promotion you received or contacting Frontier Airlines customer service for clarification.

Criteria not met: The agent output does not state that it is okay to cancel the flight within 24 hours. Instead it says the membership status depends on the promotion’s terms and that the membership might be voided if the flight is canceled, and it recommends checking terms or contacting customer service. Therefore it does not meet the criterion.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_3`

**Failures:** 35 times

**Question:** If both of my small bags fit completely under the seat in front of me without taking any extra space, that counts as one personal item, correct?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: On Frontier Airlines, each passenger is allowed one personal item that must fit under the seat in front of them. This personal item can be a purse, backpack, or similar item. If you have two small bags, each would typically count as a separate item. Therefore, even if both bags fit under the seat, they would still be considered two separate personal items, not one. You would need to consolidate them into one bag to comply with the personal item policy.

Criteria not met: The agent_output explicitly states that two small bags would typically count as separate personal items and would be considered two items, not one. This contradicts the criterion requiring the output to confirm that both small bags count as one personal item. Therefore it fails the criterion.

**Question:** Do miles in family pool expire?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Miles in a Frontier Airlines Family Pool do not expire as long as there is accrual activity in the account every twelve months. This means that if any member of the pool generates activity, such as earning miles through purchases or other eligible activities, the miles for the entire pool will remain active.

AssertionError: Failed response: Yes, you can bring a domesticated dog on a Frontier Airlines flight within the U.S. for a one-way fee. Here are some important guidelines to keep in mind:

- Pets must stay in their travel container at all times.
- Checked pets are not allowed.

- It must fit under the seat in front of you.
- Maximum size for hard-sided carriers: 18" L x 14" W x 8" H.
- Maximum size for soft-sided carriers: 18" L x 14" W x 11" H.
- Soft-sided carriers are recommended.
- Only one adult dog or cat per container is allowed.
- You may bring one personal item or a carry-on in addition to your pet (carry-on fees apply).

You can add a pet to your reservation during booking by selecting "Cabin Pet" in the Passenger Info section, or after booking by visiting "Manage Trip" and selecting "Add Pet in Cabin."

If your flight is international or involves a service animal, please let me know for more specific information.

**Failures:** 10 times

**Question:** does frontier reserve the right to cancel the miles program at any time. if so, do i risk losing all my miles?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Frontier Airlines reserves the right to change its Frontier Miles program and its terms and conditions at any time without notice. This means that there is a possibility that the program could be altered or even canceled, which could potentially affect your accumulated miles. Therefore, while it is not common for airlines to cancel such programs outright, there is a risk that changes could impact your miles.
