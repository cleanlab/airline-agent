<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC, it's important to consider both TSA regulations and the laws of the states you are traveling to and from. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Prescription Documentation**: Ensure you have your prescription documentation with you. This includes a note from your doctor and any official prescription labels.

2. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked bags. However, they recommend that medications be clearly labeled to facilitate the security process. Liquid medications are typically allowed in reasonable quantities exceeding the 3.4-ounce limit, but you should declare them to TSA officers at the checkpoint for inspection.

3. **State Laws**: Since THC is not federally legal in the United States, you should be aware of the laws in both your departure and arrival states. Some states have specific regulations regarding the transportation of THC products, even if they are prescribed.

4. **Airline Policies**: Check with Frontier Airlines for any specific policies they might have regarding the transportation of medical marijuana.

It's advisable to contact TSA directly or consult their website for the most current information, as regulations can change. Additionally, consulting with legal counsel or a medical professional familiar with your situation might be beneficial.

Criteria not met: The agent output explicitly states “Since THC is not federally legal in the United States,” which directly mentions that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with. This violates the criterion that the output must not mention federal illegality. Therefore the output fails the criterion.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_2`

**Failures:** 1 times

<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: If you received a Discount Den membership as part of a promotion when booking a flight, and you cancel that flight within 24 hours, the status of your Discount Den membership may depend on the specific terms of the promotion. Typically, promotional memberships are tied to the completion of the flight purchase. If the flight is canceled, especially within the 24-hour window, the promotional membership might also be voided.

To ensure you retain the membership, you should check the specific terms and conditions of the promotion you received or contact Frontier Airlines customer service for clarification.

Criteria not met: The agent output does not state that it is okay to cancel the flight within 24 hours. Instead, it says the Discount Den membership may be voided if the flight is canceled within the 24-hour window and advises checking terms or contacting customer service. Therefore it does not meet the criterion.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_3`

**Failures:** 6 times

**Question:** If both of my small bags fit completely under the seat in front of me without taking any extra space, that counts as one personal item, correct?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Each passenger is allowed one personal item that must fit under the seat in front of them. If you have two small bags, each would be considered a separate personal item. Therefore, even if both bags fit under the seat, they would count as two personal items, not one. You are allowed only one personal item, so you would need to consolidate your belongings into a single bag to comply with the policy.

Criteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that two small bags would be considered separate personal items and would count as two personal items, not one. This contradicts the criterion, which requires confirming that both small bags count as one personal item. Therefore the output does not meet the criterion.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_trustworthiness_guardrail_2`

**Failures:** 3 times

**Question:** Do miles in family pool expire?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: In a Frontier Airlines family pool, the head of the pool is responsible for managing the miles. However, the information about whether only one person in the pool needs to have accrual activity to keep the entire pool's miles from expiring is not explicitly detailed in the available resources. Typically, accrual activity is required to prevent miles from expiring, but it's best to confirm specific policies directly with Frontier Airlines or through their official resources.

Criteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that the information is not explicitly detailed and does not confirm that only one person in the family pool needs accrual activity to keep the entire pool’s miles from expiring. Instead it advises confirming with Frontier. Therefore it does not meet the criterion requiring explicit confirmation that only one person’s activity suffices.

**Failures:** 11 times

**Question:** can i bring a dog with me on a flight?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: I'm sorry, but I don't have the information you're looking for. Please rephrase the question or contact Frontier Airlines customer support for further assistance.

Criteria not met: The agent output does not ask any clarifying question. It only says it does not have the information and asks the user to rephrase or contact Frontier Airlines. It does not ask whether the user is asking about a domestic or international flight, so it fails the criterion.
