<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC, it's important to consider both TSA regulations and the laws of the states you are traveling to and from. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oils, remain illegal under federal law, except for products that contain no more than 0.3% THC on a dry weight basis or are approved by the FDA.

2. **State Laws**: Even if you have a prescription, you should ensure that both your departure and arrival states allow the possession of THC for medical purposes. Laws can vary significantly between states.

3. **Documentation**: Carry your prescription and any relevant documentation with you. This can help if you are questioned by security or law enforcement.

4. **Packaging**: Keep the medication in its original packaging with the prescription label visible.

5. **Consult with Authorities**: If you are unsure, it's a good idea to contact the airline or airport security in advance to clarify their policies.

For your specific situation, if your prescription THC is legal in both your departure and arrival locations and complies with TSA guidelines, you should be able to carry it in your carry-on. However, always double-check the latest regulations and consult with relevant authorities if in doubt.

Criteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that "marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products... remain illegal under federal law," which directly mentions that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with. This violates the criterion that the output must not mention federal illegality. Therefore the output fails the criterion.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_3`

**Failures:** 29 times

**Question:** If both of my small bags fit completely under the seat in front of me without taking any extra space, that counts as one personal item, correct?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Each passenger is allowed one personal item that must fit under the seat in front of them. If you have two small bags, each would be considered a separate personal item. Therefore, even if both bags fit under the seat, they would count as two personal items, not one. You are allowed only one personal item, so you would need to consolidate your belongings into a single bag to comply with the policy.

Criteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that two small bags would be considered two personal items and that the passenger is allowed only one personal item, requiring consolidation. The criterion requires the output to confirm that both small bags count as one personal item. Because the agent output says the opposite, it does not meet the criterion.

<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Miles in a Frontier Airlines Family Pool do not expire as long as there is accrual activity in the account every twelve months. This means that if any member of the pool generates activity, such as earning miles through flights or purchases with the FRONTIER Airlines World Mastercard, the miles for the entire pool will remain active.

**Question:** does frontier reserve the right to cancel the miles program at any time. if so, do i risk losing all my miles?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Frontier Airlines reserves the right to change its Frontier Miles program and its terms and conditions at any time without notice. This means that there is a possibility that the program could be altered or even canceled, which could potentially affect your accumulated miles. Therefore, while it is not common for airlines to cancel such programs outright, there is a risk that changes could impact your miles.
