##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_1`

**Failures:** 50 times

**Question:** can i pack my prescription thc in my carry on so that its accessible to me during my flight? ill need it if i get an anxiety attack on take off.


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Traveling with prescription THC can be complex due to varying laws and regulations. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Prescription and Documentation**: Ensure you have a valid prescription and any necessary documentation from your healthcare provider. This documentation should clearly state that the THC is for medical use.

2. **TSA Regulations**: The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oils, remain illegal under federal law, except for products that contain no more than 0.3% THC on a dry weight basis or are approved by the FDA.

3. **State Laws**: Check the laws of the states you are traveling to and from, as well as any states you may be passing through. Some states have legalized medical and/or recreational marijuana, while others have not.

4. **Airline Policies**: Verify with Frontier Airlines if they have any specific policies regarding traveling with medical marijuana.

5. **Security Screening**: Be prepared for additional screening. Having your documentation readily available can help facilitate the process.

It's important to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations to avoid any issues during your travel. If in doubt, consult legal advice or contact the relevant authorities for guidance.

Criteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that “marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products... remain illegal under federal law,” which directly mentions federal illegality of THC/cannabis. This violates the criterion that the output must not mention that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with. Therefore the output fails.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_2`

**Failures:** 5 times

**Question:** i saw your promo of a free discount den pass no enrollment fee and no annual fee with any accrual activity. i received the discount den after booking a flight. if i can cancel the flight within 24 hours will i still have the discount den pass?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: If you received a Discount Den membership as part of a flight booking and then cancel that flight within 24 hours, the status of your Discount Den membership would depend on the specific terms and conditions associated with the promotion you used. Typically, promotional memberships are tied to the completion of the qualifying activity (in this case, the flight). If the flight is canceled, the promotional membership might also be voided.

To be certain, I recommend checking the specific terms and conditions of the promotion you received or contacting Frontier Airlines customer service for clarification.

Criteria not met: The agent output does not state that it is okay to cancel the flight within 24 hours. Instead it says the membership status depends on the promotion’s terms and that the membership might be voided if the flight is canceled, and it recommends checking terms or contacting customer service. Therefore it does not meet the criterion.

**Failures:** 33 times

**Question:** If both of my small bags fit completely under the seat in front of me without taking any extra space, that counts as one personal item, correct?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: For Frontier Airlines, a personal item must be no larger than 14 inches high, 18 inches wide, and 8 inches deep, including handles, wheels, and straps. If both of your small bags fit completely under the seat in front of you and together do not exceed these dimensions, they would count as one personal item. However, typically only one personal item is allowed per passenger, so combining two bags to fit these dimensions might not be permissible. It's best to ensure that your combined items fit within the specified size limit for a single personal item.

Criteria not met: The agent output is ambiguous and does not definitively confirm that both small bags count as one personal item. It states they "would" count as one item if they fit under the seat and together do not exceed dimensions, but then immediately says combining two bags "might not be permissible," creating a contradiction. Because it does not clearly confirm that both bags count as one personal item, the output fails the criterion.

**Question:** Do miles in family pool expire?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Miles in a Frontier Airlines Family Pool do not expire as long as there is accrual activity in the account every twelve months. This means that if any member of the pool generates activity, such as earning miles through purchases or other eligible activities, the miles for the entire pool will remain active.

```
AssertionError: Failed response: Yes, you can bring a domesticated dog on a Frontier Airlines flight within the U.S. for a one-way fee. Here are some important guidelines to consider:

- Pets must stay in their travel container at all times.
- Checked pets are not allowed.
- Only service dogs are allowed on international flights, and they must meet CDC requirements.
- Pets must be at least 8 weeks old to travel.

**Pet Carrier Requirements:**

- The carrier must be large enough for your pet to stand, turn around, and lie down naturally.
- It must fit under the seat in front of you.
- Maximum size for hard-sided carriers: 18" L x 14" W x 8" H.
- Maximum size for soft-sided carriers: 18" L x 14" W x 11" H.
- Soft-sided carriers are recommended.
- Only one adult dog or cat per container is allowed.
- You may bring one personal item or a carry-on in addition to your pet (carry-on fees apply).

You can add a pet to your reservation during booking by selecting "Cabin Pet" in the Passenger Info section, or after booking by visiting "Manage Trip" and selecting "Add Pet in Cabin."

If your flight is international or if your dog is a service animal, please let me know so I can provide additional information.

**Question:** does frontier reserve the right to cancel the miles program at any time. if so, do i risk losing all my miles?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Frontier Airlines reserves the right to change its Frontier Miles program and its terms and conditions at any time without notice. This means that there is a possibility that the program could be altered or even canceled, which could potentially affect your accumulated miles. Therefore, while it is not common for airlines to cancel such programs outright, there is a risk that changes could impact your miles.
