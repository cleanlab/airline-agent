<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC, it's important to consider both TSA regulations and the laws of the states you are traveling to and from. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Prescription Documentation**: Ensure you have your prescription documentation with you. This includes a note from your doctor and the original prescription label on the packaging.

2. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, they recommend that you carry them in your carry-on for easy access and to prevent loss.

3. **State Laws**: Check the laws regarding THC in both your departure and arrival states. While some states have legalized medical and recreational marijuana, others have not, and federal law still classifies marijuana as a controlled substance.

4. **Security Screening**: Be prepared for your medication to be inspected during security screening. It's helpful to inform the TSA officer that you are carrying prescription medication.

5. **Airline Policies**: While TSA handles security, airlines may have their own policies regarding the transport of THC. It's a good idea to check with Frontier Airlines directly for any specific restrictions they might have.

If you have any concerns or need specific advice, consulting with legal counsel or a medical professional familiar with travel regulations might be beneficial.

Criteria not met: The agent output explicitly references federal law, stating that "federal law still classifies marijuana as a controlled substance," which effectively mentions federal illegality. The criterion requires that the output does not mention that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with. Therefore the output fails the criterion.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_2`

**Failures:** 4 times

**Question:** i saw your promo of a free discount den pass no enrollment fee and no annual fee with any accrual activity. i received the discount den after booking a flight. if i can cancel the flight within 24 hours will i still have the discount den pass?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: If you received a Discount Den membership as part of a promotion when booking a flight, and you cancel that flight within 24 hours, the status of your Discount Den membership may depend on the specific terms of the promotion. Typically, promotional memberships are tied to the completion of the associated activity (in this case, the flight booking).

To ensure you retain the Discount Den membership after canceling the flight, you should check the specific terms and conditions of the promotion you received. If the promotion does not explicitly state that the membership is contingent upon the flight being completed, you may still retain the membership. However, if the terms specify that the membership is only valid with the flight, canceling the flight might void the membership.

For a definitive answer, I recommend contacting Frontier Airlines customer service directly to clarify the terms of your specific promotion.

Criteria not met: The agent output does not state that it is okay to cancel the flight within 24 hours. Instead, it says the membership status "may depend" on promotion terms and that canceling "might void" the membership, recommending to check terms or contact customer service. It therefore does not meet the criterion requiring the output to say it is okay to cancel within 24 hours.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_3`

**Failures:** 31 times

**Question:** If both of my small bags fit completely under the seat in front of me without taking any extra space, that counts as one personal item, correct?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: On Frontier Airlines, each passenger is allowed to bring one personal item on board for free. A personal item must fit under the seat in front of you and typically includes items like a purse, briefcase, or small backpack. If you have two small bags, each would be considered a separate personal item, even if they both fit under the seat. Therefore, you would need to consolidate them into one bag to qualify as a single personal item. Otherwise, the second bag would be subject to additional fees as a carry-on or checked bag.

Criteria not met: The agent_output explicitly states that two small bags would be considered separate personal items and that the second bag would be subject to additional fees unless consolidated. The criterion requires that the output confirm both small bags count as one personal item. Because the agent_output contradicts this requirement, it does not meet the criterion.

**Failures:** 8 times

**Question:** Do miles in family pool expire?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: In a Frontier Airlines family pool, the head of the pool is responsible for managing the miles. However, the information about whether only one person in the pool needs to generate activity to keep the miles from expiring is not explicitly detailed in the available resources. Typically, accrual activity is required to prevent miles from expiring, but it's best to confirm with Frontier Airlines directly for specific policies regarding family pooling and activity requirements.

Criteria not met: The agent output does not confirm that only one person in the pool needs activity to keep the entire pool alive. Instead, it states that the information is not explicitly detailed and recommends confirming with Frontier Airlines. Therefore it does not meet the criterion.

**Question:** does frontier reserve the right to cancel the miles program at any time. if so, do i risk losing all my miles?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Frontier Airlines reserves the right to change its Frontier Miles program and its terms and conditions at any time without notice. This means that there is a possibility that the program could be altered or even canceled, which could potentially affect your accumulated miles. Therefore, while it is not common for airlines to cancel such programs outright, there is a risk that changes could impact your miles.
