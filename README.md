<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC, it's important to consider both TSA regulations and the laws of the states you are traveling to and from. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Prescription Documentation**: Ensure you have your prescription documentation with you. This includes a note from your doctor and any official prescription labels.

2. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, they recommend that you carry them in your carry-on for easy access and to prevent loss.

3. **State Laws**: Check the laws regarding THC in both your departure and arrival states. While some states have legalized medical and recreational marijuana, others have not, and federal law still classifies marijuana as a controlled substance.

4. **Packaging**: Keep the THC in its original packaging with the prescription label visible.

5. **Security Screening**: Be prepared to declare your medication at the security checkpoint and provide documentation if requested.

It's always a good idea to check with the airline and review the latest TSA guidelines before your flight to ensure compliance with all regulations.

Criteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that "federal law still classifies marijuana as a controlled substance," which directly mentions federal illegality of THC/cannabis. This violates the criterion that the output must not mention that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with. Therefore the output fails the criterion.

**Failures:** 1 times

<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: If you received a Discount Den membership as part of a promotion when booking a flight, and you cancel that flight within 24 hours, the status of your Discount Den membership may depend on the specific terms of the promotion. Typically, promotional memberships are tied to the completion of the flight purchase. If the flight is canceled, especially within the 24-hour window, the promotional membership might also be voided.

To ensure you retain the membership, you should check the specific terms and conditions of the promotion you received or contact Frontier Airlines customer service for clarification.

Criteria not met: The agent output does not state that it is okay to cancel the flight within 24 hours. Instead, it says the Discount Den membership may be voided if the flight is canceled within the 24-hour window and advises checking terms or contacting customer service. Therefore it does not meet the criterion.

##### `tests/stable/test_guardrails.py::test_additional_trustworthiness_guardrail_3`

**Failures:** 15 times

**Question:** If both of my small bags fit completely under the seat in front of me without taking any extra space, that counts as one personal item, correct?


<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: On Frontier Airlines, each passenger is allowed to bring one personal item on board for free. A personal item must fit under the seat in front of you and typically includes items like a purse, briefcase, or small backpack. If you have two small bags, each must individually qualify as a personal item by fitting under the seat. If both bags fit under the seat together without taking extra space, they might still be considered as two separate items. It's important to ensure that each bag individually meets the size requirements for a personal item. If you need to bring both bags, you may need to pay for an additional carry-on or checked bag.

Criteria not met: The agent output does not confirm that both small bags count as one personal item. Instead, it states that each bag must individually qualify as a personal item, that they might be considered two separate items even if they both fit under the seat, and suggests you may need to pay for an additional bag. This contradicts the required confirmation, so it fails.

<details>
<summary><strong>View full failure log</strong></summary>



```
AssertionError: Failed response: Miles in a Frontier Airlines Family Pool do not expire as long as there is accrual activity in the account every twelve months. This means that if any member of the pool generates activity, such as earning miles through purchases or other eligible activities, the miles for the entire pool will remain active.
