However, it's always a good idea to check the specific terms and conditions related to your membership offer or contact Frontier Airlines directly for confirmation.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output does not explicitly state that it is okay to cancel the flight within 24 hours. It only describes the consequence (Discount Den membership typically remains active) if you cancel within 24 hours, but does not affirm that cancelling within 24 hours is permitted or 'okay.'

It states a conditional ('would count... if they fit... when combined') and then contradicts that by saying combining two bags might not be permissible and typically only one personal item is allowed unless contained within a single bag.

It only says the Discount Den membership 'may' depend on promotion terms and 'might' be voided if the flight is canceled, and recommends checking terms or contacting customer service.

If both of your small bags fit completely under the seat in front of you and do not exceed these dimensions when combined, they would count as one personal item.

It's best to ensure that each bag individually meets the size requirements for a personal item.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent_output does not clearly confirm that both small bags count as one personal item. It states a conditional (\u201cif both... fit... they would count as one personal item\u201d) but then contradicts this by saying combining two bags might not be permissible and that typically only one personal item is allowed.

If the promotion does not specify that the membership is contingent on the flight being completed, you may still retain the membership. However, if the promotion terms are not clear, contacting Frontier Airlines customer service directly would provide the most accurate information.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent_output does not state that it is okay to cancel the flight within 24 hours. Instead, it says the Discount Den membership status may depend on promotion terms and advises checking terms or contacting customer service. It does not assert that canceling within 24 hours is allowed or will retain the membership, so it fails the criterion."

Therefore it fails the criterion."

If the promotion does not specify that the membership is contingent on the flight being completed, you may still retain the membership after cancellation.

Instead, it says the Discount Den membership status may depend on promotional terms, that you may or may not retain the membership, and recommends checking terms or contacting Frontier. It does not assert that cancellation within 24 hours is acceptable, so it fails the criterion."
