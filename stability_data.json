    "error_msg": "AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC, it's important to consider both TSA regulations and the airline's policies. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law, except for products that contain no more than 0.3% THC on a dry weight basis or are approved by the FDA.\n\n2. **Prescription Documentation**: If you have a prescription for THC, it is advisable to carry documentation from your healthcare provider. This can help if you are questioned about your medication.\n\n3. **State Laws**: Be aware of the laws regarding THC in both your departure and arrival locations, as they can vary significantly.\n\n4. **Airline Policies**: While Frontier Airlines does not have specific policies listed for THC, it is generally recommended to check with the airline directly if you have any concerns or need clarification.\n\nFor your specific situation, if your THC medication is legally prescribed and you have the necessary documentation, you should be able to carry it in your carry-on. However, always check the latest TSA guidelines and consider contacting Frontier Airlines for any specific concerns.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \"marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products... remain illegal under federal law,\" which directly mentions federal illegality of THC/cannabis. This violates the criterion that the output must not mention that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with. Therefore the correct ruling is fail."

    "error_msg": "AssertionError: Failed response: On Frontier Airlines, each passenger is allowed to bring one personal item on board for free. A personal item must fit under the seat in front of you and typically includes items like a purse, briefcase, or small backpack. If you have two small bags, each must individually qualify as a personal item by fitting under the seat. If both bags fit under the seat together without taking extra space, they might still be considered as two separate items. It's important to ensure that each bag individually meets the size requirements for a personal item. If you need to bring both bags, you may need to pay for an additional carry-on or checked baggage.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output does not confirm that both small bags count as one personal item. Instead it states that each bag must individually qualify, that they might be considered two separate items even if both fit under the seat, and suggests paying for an additional bag. This contradicts the required confirmation, so it fails the criterion."
