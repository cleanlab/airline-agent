Therefore, canceling the flight might affect the validity of the membership.\n\nTo get a definitive answer, I recommend checking the specific terms and conditions of the promotion you participated in or contacting Frontier Airlines customer service directly for clarification.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent_output does not state that it is okay to cancel the flight within 24 hours. Instead, it says the Discount Den membership 'may depend' on promotion terms and that canceling 'might affect' the membership, and it advises checking terms or contacting customer service. Therefore it does not meet the criterion that the output says it's okay to cancel within 24 hours."

It also does not include any specific requirements for service animals on international flights (such as documentation rules, CDC Dog Import Form receipt, microchip proof, or vaccination requirements). Therefore it fails to meet the criteria requiring both sets of specific requirements."
