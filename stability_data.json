Generally, promotional memberships are tied to the completion of the associated activity (in this case, the flight booking).\n\nTo ensure you retain the Discount Den membership after canceling the flight, you should check the specific terms and conditions of the promotion you participated in. If the promotion does not specify that the membership is contingent on the flight being completed, you may still retain the membership. However, if the promotion terms are not clear, contacting Frontier Airlines customer service directly would provide the most accurate information regarding your specific situation.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent_output does not state that it is okay to cancel the flight within 24 hours. Instead, it says the membership status \"may depend on the specific terms\" and advises checking terms or contacting customer service; it does not explicitly affirm that canceling within 24 hours is acceptable. Therefore it fails the criterion."

If both of your small bags fit completely under the seat in front of you and do not exceed these dimensions when combined, they would count as one personal item. However, typically only one personal item is allowed per passenger, so combining two bags to fit these dimensions might not be permissible unless they are contained within a single bag or structure.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent_output does not unambiguously confirm that both small bags count as one personal item. It gives a conditional statement that they \"would count\" if the combined dimensions fit, but then contradicts this by saying typically only one personal item is allowed and combining two bags might not be permissible unless they are contained within a single bag or structure. Because it fails to clearly confirm that both bags count as one personal item, the output does not meet the criteria."

    "error_msg": "AssertionError: Failed response: If you received a Discount Den membership as part of a promotion when booking a flight, and you cancel that flight within 24 hours, the status of your Discount Den membership may depend on the specific terms of the promotion. Generally, promotional memberships are tied to the conditions under which they were granted. \n\nTo ensure you retain the membership, you should check the specific terms and conditions of the promotion you participated in. If the promotion does not specify that the membership is contingent on maintaining the flight booking, you may be able to keep the membership. However, if the promotion terms are not clear, contacting Frontier Airlines customer service directly would provide the most accurate information.\n\nCriteria not met: The output does not explicitly state that it is okay to cancel the flight within 24 hours. It gives conditional language (\"may depend\", \"you may be able to keep the membership\") and advises checking terms or contacting customer service, rather than affirming that canceling within 24 hours is permitted. Therefore it fails the criterion."

A personal item must fit under the seat in front of you and typically includes items like a purse, briefcase, or small backpack. If you have two small bags, each must individually qualify as a personal item by fitting under the seat.

You would need to consolidate them into one bag to count as a single personal item.\n\nCriteria not met: Fail \u2014 The agent's output explicitly states that two separate small bags count as two personal items and says you would need to consolidate them to count as a single personal item.

If you have two small bags, even if they both fit under the seat, they would generally be considered as two separate items. Frontier Airlines allows one personal item per passenger, so having two bags would not count as a single personal item. You would need to consolidate them into one bag or check the airline's specific baggage policy for additional options or fees.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent_output states that two small bags would be considered two separate items and that Frontier allows only one personal item, so having two bags would not count as a single personal item. This contradicts the criterion which requires the output to confirm that both small bags count as one personal item. Therefore it fails the criterion."
