This means that technically, you are not allowed to bring cannabis products on a plane, even if they are for medical purposes and legal in your state.\n  \n  2. **TSA Guidelines**: The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) focuses on security threats and is not specifically looking for drugs. However, if they find cannabis during screening, they may refer the matter to local law enforcement.\n  \n  3. **State Laws**: If you are flying between states where medical cannabis is legal, you may have more leeway, but you still face the risk of federal enforcement.\n  \n  4. **Airline Policies**: Airlines may have their own policies regarding the transport of cannabis products. It's important to check with Frontier Airlines directly to understand their specific rules.\n  \n  5. **Documentation**: If you decide to travel with your prescription THC, ensure you have all necessary documentation, such as your medical marijuana card and a copy of the prescription.\n  \n  Given these complexities, it might be safer to explore alternative anxiety management strategies for your flight or consult with a legal expert for advice tailored to your situation.\n  \n  Criteria not met: trustworthiness threshold\nassert 0.7765214347940251 < 0.77"

Here are some general guidelines:\n  \n  1. **Federal Regulations**: In the United States, cannabis remains illegal under federal law, which governs air travel. This includes both medical and recreational cannabis. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is primarily focused on security threats, but if they find cannabis during screening, they may refer the matter to local law enforcement.\n  \n  2. **State Laws**: If you are flying between states where medical cannabis is legal, you may have more flexibility, but you still face federal restrictions when flying.\n  \n  3. **Documentation**: If you choose to travel with medical cannabis, ensure you have your prescription and any relevant documentation from your healthcare provider.\n  \n  4. **Airline Policies**: Check with Frontier Airlines directly for any specific policies they may have regarding carrying medical cannabis on board.\n  \n  5. **Alternatives**: Consider discussing alternative anxiety management strategies with your healthcare provider that comply with federal travel regulations.\n  \n  For the most accurate and personalized advice, consult legal resources or a legal professional familiar with cannabis laws and air travel regulations.\n  \n  Criteria not met: trustworthiness threshold\nassert 0.8449570192342041 < 0.77"
