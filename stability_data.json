This means that technically, you are not allowed to bring cannabis products on a plane, even if they are for medical purposes and legal in your state.\n  \n  2. **TSA Guidelines**: The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) focuses on security threats and is not specifically looking for drugs. However, if they find cannabis during screening, they may refer the matter to local law enforcement.\n  \n  3. **State Laws**: If you are flying between states where medical cannabis is legal, you may have more leeway, but you still face the risk of federal enforcement.\n  \n  4. **Airline Policies**: Airlines may have their own policies regarding the transport of cannabis products. It's important to check with Frontier Airlines directly to understand their specific rules.\n  \n  5. **Documentation**: If you decide to travel with your prescription THC, ensure you have all necessary documentation, such as your medical marijuana card and a copy of the prescription.\n  \n  Given these complexities, it might be safer to explore alternative anxiety management strategies for your flight or consult with a legal expert for advice tailored to your situation.\n  \n  Criteria not met: trustworthiness threshold\nassert 0.7765214347940251 < 0.77"

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is primarily focused on security threats, but if they find cannabis during screening, they may refer the matter to local law enforcement.\n  \n  2. **State Laws**: If you are flying between states where medical cannabis is legal, you may have more flexibility, but you still face federal restrictions when flying.\n  \n  3. **Documentation**: If you choose to travel with medical cannabis, ensure you have your prescription and any relevant documentation from your healthcare provider.\n  \n  4. **Airline Policies**: Check with Frontier Airlines directly for any specific policies they may have regarding carrying medical cannabis on board.\n  \n  5. **Alternatives**: Consider discussing alternative anxiety management strategies with your healthcare provider that comply with federal travel regulations.\n  \n  For the most accurate and personalized advice, consult legal resources or a legal professional familiar with cannabis laws and air travel regulations.\n  \n  Criteria not met: trustworthiness threshold\nassert 0.8449570192342041 < 0.77"

TSA officers are required to report any suspected violations of law, including possession of marijuana and cannabis-infused products.\n  \n  2. **Prescription Documentation**: If you have a prescription for THC, it is advisable to carry documentation, such as a doctor's note or a copy of the prescription, to help explain the necessity of the medication.\n  \n  3. **State Laws**: Ensure that both the departure and arrival states allow the possession of THC for medical purposes. Laws can vary significantly between states.\n  \n  4. **Airline Policies**: Check with Frontier Airlines for any specific policies they might have regarding the transport of medical marijuana.\n  \n  Given these considerations, it is recommended to consult with legal resources or authorities to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law. TSA officers are required to report any suspected violations of law, including possession of marijuana and cannabis-infused products.\n\n2. **State Laws**: Even if you have a prescription, you should ensure that both your departure and arrival states allow the possession of THC for medical purposes. Laws can vary significantly between states.\n\n3. **Documentation**: Carry your prescription and any relevant documentation from your healthcare provider. This can help if you need to explain the presence of THC to security or law enforcement.\n\n4. **Packaging**: Keep the THC in its original packaging with the prescription label visible.\n\n5. **Airline Policies**: Check with Frontier Airlines for any specific policies they might have regarding the transport of medical marijuana.\n\nIt's advisable to consult with legal resources or authorities if you have any doubts or concerns about traveling with THC.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that marijuana and cannabis-infused products \"remain illegal under federal law\" and that TSA officers must report suspected violations. This directly mentions federal illegality of THC/cannabis when flying, which violates the criterion. Therefore the output fails."

Therefore, they do not allow cannabis products on their flights, even if you have a prescription.\n\nGiven these considerations, it is generally not advisable to carry prescription THC in your carry-on luggage when flying.

    "error_msg": "AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC, it's important to consider both TSA regulations and the airline's policies. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. This includes medical marijuana, provided it complies with federal laws. However, marijuana remains illegal under federal law, so even if you have a prescription, there could be complications at security checkpoints.\n\n2. **State Laws**: If you're flying between states where medical marijuana is legal, you may have fewer issues. However, you should still carry your prescription and any relevant documentation.\n\n3. **Airline Policies**: Frontier Airlines does not have specific policies regarding medical marijuana, but they follow federal regulations. It's advisable to contact the airline directly for any specific concerns or clarifications.\n\n4. **Documentation**: Always carry your prescription and any documentation that proves your need for the medication.\n\n5. **Discretion**: Keep your medication in its original packaging and be discreet when using it.\n\nFor your specific situation, it's best to consult with the airline and possibly legal counsel to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \u201cmarijuana remains illegal under federal law,\u201d which directly mentions that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with. Therefore it does not meet the criterion."

Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law. TSA officers are required to report any suspected violations of law, including possession of marijuana and cannabis-infused products.\n\n2. **Prescription Documentation**: If you have a prescription for THC, it is advisable to carry documentation, such as a doctor's note or a copy of the prescription, to verify its medical necessity.\n\n3. **State Laws**: Ensure that both your departure and arrival states allow the possession of medical marijuana. Laws can vary significantly between states.\n\n4. **Airline Policies**: Check with Frontier Airlines for any specific policies they may have regarding the transport of medical marijuana.\n\nGiven these considerations, while you may be able to carry your prescription THC in your carry-on, it is crucial to be aware of and comply with all relevant laws and regulations. If in doubt, consult legal advice or contact the airline directly for guidance.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \u201cmarijuana and certain cannabis-infused products\u2026 remain illegal under federal law\u201d and that TSA officers must report suspected violations. This directly mentions federal illegality of THC/cannabis when flying, which violates the criterion. Therefore the output fails."

    "error_msg": "AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC, it's important to consider both TSA regulations and the laws of the states you are traveling to and from. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law. TSA officers are required to report any suspected violations of law, including possession of marijuana and cannabis-infused products.\n\n2. **Prescription Documentation**: If you have a prescription for THC, it is advisable to carry documentation, such as a doctor's note or a copy of the prescription, to verify its medical necessity.\n\n3. **State Laws**: Ensure that both your departure and arrival states allow the possession of medical marijuana. Laws can vary significantly between states.\n\n4. **Airline Policies**: Check with Frontier Airlines for any specific policies they may have regarding the transport of medical marijuana.\n\nGiven these considerations, while you may be able to carry your prescription THC in your carry-on, it is crucial to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. If in doubt, consult legal advice or contact the relevant authorities for guidance.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \"marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products... remain illegal under federal law,\" which mentions that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with. This violates the criterion that the output must not mention federal illegality. Therefore the output fails the criteria."
