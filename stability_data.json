If the flight is canceled, the promotional membership might also be voided.\n\nTo be certain, I recommend checking the specific terms and conditions of the promotion you received or contacting Frontier Airlines customer service for clarification on how your Discount Den membership will be affected by the flight cancellation.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output does not state that it is okay to cancel the flight within 24 hours. It only says the membership status may depend on promotion terms and that the promotional membership might be voided, and recommends checking terms or contacting customer service.

Instead, it says the Discount Den membership status may depend on promotion terms and might be voided, and advises checking terms or contacting customer service.

It gives a conditional statement that they \"would\" count if they fit combined within size limits, but then contradicts that by saying combining two bags might not be permissible unless they are contained within a single bag.
