Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Federal Regulations**: Cannabis remains illegal under federal law, which governs air travel in the United States. This includes both medical and recreational cannabis. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is primarily focused on security threats, but if they discover cannabis during screening, they may refer the matter to local law enforcement.\n\n2. **Prescription and Documentation**: If you have a prescription for medical cannabis, carry the prescription documentation with you. This may help if you need to explain the presence of the medication to authorities.\n\n3. **State Laws**: Consider the laws of the state you are departing from and your destination. Some states have more lenient laws regarding medical cannabis, but these do not override federal regulations.\n\n4. **Airline Policies**: Check with Frontier Airlines directly for any specific policies they may have regarding the transport of medical cannabis.\n\n5. **Alternatives**: If possible, consider alternative medications that are not subject to these restrictions for managing anxiety during your flight.\n\nIt's advisable to consult with legal counsel or a medical professional familiar with the laws regarding medical cannabis and air travel to ensure compliance and avoid any potential issues.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \"Cannabis remains illegal under federal law, which governs air travel in the United States\" and notes TSA may refer discovery to law enforcement. This directly mentions federal illegality of cannabis for air travel, violating the criterion that the output must not mention that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with."

Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Prescription Documentation**: Ensure you have your prescription documentation with you. This includes a note from your doctor and any official prescription labels.\n\n2. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, they recommend that you carry them in your carry-on for easy access and to prevent loss.\n\n3. **State Laws**: Check the laws regarding THC in both your departure and arrival states. While some states have legalized medical and recreational marijuana, others have not, and federal law still classifies marijuana as a controlled substance.\n\n4. **Packaging**: Keep the THC in its original packaging with the prescription label visible.\n\n5. **Security Screening**: Be prepared to declare your medication at the security checkpoint. TSA officers have the discretion to allow or prohibit items through the checkpoint.\n\nIt's always a good idea to check the latest TSA guidelines and consult with your airline if you have specific concerns.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \u201cfederal law still classifies marijuana as a controlled substance,\u201d which directly mentions the federal legal status (i.e., that it is federally illegal). This violates the criterion. Ruling: fail."

    "error_msg": "AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC or any medical cannabis product, it's important to consider both federal and airline-specific regulations. Here are some key points to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Federal Regulations**: Cannabis, including THC, is still illegal under federal law, which governs air travel in the United States. This means that even if you have a prescription, carrying THC on a flight can be problematic.\n\n2. **TSA Guidelines**: The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) focuses on security threats and is not specifically looking for drugs. However, if they find cannabis during screening, they will refer the matter to local law enforcement.\n\n3. **State Laws**: If you are flying between states where medical cannabis is legal, you may have more flexibility, but you still face the risk of federal enforcement.\n\n4. **Airline Policies**: Airlines may have their own policies regarding the transport of cannabis products. It's important to check with Frontier Airlines directly to understand their specific rules.\n\nGiven these considerations, it is generally not advisable to carry THC in your carry-on luggage. If you have a medical need, consult with your doctor and consider alternative medications that comply with federal regulations for air travel.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states, \"Cannabis, including THC, is still illegal under federal law,\" and discusses federal enforcement and risks when carrying THC on a flight. Because it directly mentions that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with, it violates the criterion."

TSA officers are required to report any suspected violations of law, including possession of marijuana and cannabis-infused products.\n\n2. **Prescription Documentation**: If you have a prescription for THC, it is advisable to carry documentation from your doctor. This can help explain the necessity of the medication if questioned.\n\n3. **State Laws**: Ensure that both your departure and arrival states allow the possession of THC for medical purposes. Laws can vary significantly between states.\n\n4. **Airline Policies**: Check with Frontier Airlines for any specific policies they might have regarding the transport of medical marijuana.\n\nGiven these considerations, while you may be able to carry your prescription THC in your carry-on, it is crucial to be aware of and comply with all relevant laws and regulations. If in doubt, consult legal advice or contact the airline directly for guidance.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent_output explicitly states that \"marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products ... remain illegal under federal law,\" which directly mentions federal illegality. This violates the criterion that the output must not mention that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with. Therefore: fail."

While airlines generally follow federal law, they may have specific guidelines or restrictions.\n\n5. **Security Screening**: Be prepared for additional screening and have your documentation ready to present to TSA officers if needed.\n\nIt's advisable to contact Frontier Airlines directly for their specific policy on carrying prescription THC to ensure compliance and avoid any issues during your travel.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \u201cmarijuana and certain cannabis-infused products ... remain illegal under federal law,\u201d which directly mentions federal illegality of THC/cannabis.
