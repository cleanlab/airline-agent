    "error_msg": "AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC, it's important to consider both TSA regulations and the laws of the states you are traveling to and from. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law. TSA officers are required to report any suspected violations of law, including possession of marijuana and cannabis-infused products.\n\n2. **State Laws**: Even if you have a prescription, you should ensure that both your departure and arrival states allow the possession of THC for medical purposes. Laws can vary significantly between states.\n\n3. **Documentation**: Carry your prescription and any relevant documentation from your healthcare provider. This can help if you are questioned about your medication.\n\n4. **Packaging**: Keep your medication in its original packaging with the prescription label visible.\n\n5. **Consult with Airline**: While TSA handles security, the airline may have its own policies regarding the transport of THC products.\n\nIt's advisable to consult with legal resources or authorities if you have specific concerns about traveling with THC, as regulations can change and may vary based on your specific circumstances.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \"marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products... remain illegal under federal law,\" which directly mentions federal illegality of THC/cannabis when flying. This violates the criterion that the output must not mention that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with."

However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law. TSA officers are required to report any suspected violations of law, including possession of marijuana and cannabis-infused products.\n\n2. **State Laws**: Even if you have a prescription, you should ensure that both your departure and arrival states allow the possession of THC for medical purposes. Laws can vary significantly between states.\n\n3. **Documentation**: Carry your prescription and any relevant documentation from your healthcare provider. This can help if you are questioned about your medication.\n\n4. **Packaging**: Keep your medication in its original packaging with the prescription label visible.\n\n5. **Discretion**: Be discreet and ensure that your medication is easily accessible in case you need to present it to security officers.\n\nIt's advisable to check the latest TSA guidelines and consult with your healthcare provider or legal advisor to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \u201cmarijuana and certain cannabis-infused products... remain illegal under federal law\u201d and that TSA officers must report suspected violations.

However, they recommend that you carry them in your carry-on for easy access and to prevent loss.\n\n3. **State Laws**: Be aware of the laws regarding THC in both your departure and arrival states. While some states have legalized medical and recreational marijuana, others have not, and federal law still classifies marijuana as a controlled substance.\n\n4. **Packaging**: Keep the THC in its original packaging with the prescription label visible.\n\n5. **Security Screening**: Be prepared to declare your medication at the security checkpoint and provide documentation if requested.\n\nIt's always a good idea to check the latest TSA guidelines and consult with your airline if you have specific concerns.\n\nCriteria not met: Fail: The output explicitly states that \"federal law still classifies marijuana as a controlled substance,\" which mentions that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with, so it does not meet the criterion."

Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Prescription and Documentation**: Ensure you have a valid prescription and any necessary documentation from your healthcare provider.

However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law, except for products that contain no more than 0.3% THC on a dry weight basis or are approved by the FDA.\n\n3. **State Laws**: Check the laws of the states you are traveling from and to, as well as any states you may transit through. Some states have legalized medical and/or recreational marijuana, but others have not.\n\n4. **Airline Policies**: Verify with Frontier Airlines if they have any specific policies regarding traveling with medical THC.\n\n5. **Security Screening**: Be prepared for additional screening and have your documentation ready to present to TSA officers if needed.\n\nIt's important to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations to avoid any issues during your travel. If in doubt, consult legal advice or contact the relevant authorities for guidance.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \u201cmarijuana and certain cannabis-infused products\u2026 remain illegal under federal law,\u201d which mentions federal illegality of THC/cannabis for travel.

    "error_msg": "AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC, it's important to consider both TSA regulations and the laws of the states you are traveling to and from. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law. TSA officers are required to report any suspected violations of law, including possession of marijuana and cannabis-infused products.\n\n2. **State Laws**: Even if you have a prescription, you should ensure that both your departure and arrival states allow the possession of THC for medical purposes. Laws can vary significantly between states.\n\n3. **Documentation**: Carry your prescription and any relevant documentation from your healthcare provider. This can help if you are questioned about your medication.\n\n4. **Packaging**: Keep your medication in its original packaging with the prescription label visible.\n\n5. **Consult with Authorities**: If you have specific concerns, it may be helpful to contact the airport or airline directly for guidance.\n\nIt's crucial to be aware of the legal implications and to plan accordingly to avoid any issues during your travel.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \u201cmarijuana and certain cannabis-infused products... remain illegal under federal law\u201d and that TSA officers report suspected violations. This directly mentions federal illegality of THC/cannabis when flying, which violates the criterion. Therefore the output fails."

A personal item must fit under the seat in front of you and typically includes items like a purse, briefcase, or small backpack.

Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law. TSA officers are required to report any suspected violations of law, including possession of marijuana and cannabis-infused products.\n\n2. **State Laws**: Even if you have a prescription, you should ensure that both your departure and arrival states allow the possession of THC for medical purposes. Laws can vary significantly between states.\n\n3. **Documentation**: Carry your prescription and any relevant documentation from your healthcare provider. This can help if you are questioned about your medication.\n\n4. **Packaging**: Keep your medication in its original packaging with the prescription label visible.\n\n5. **Consult with Airline**: While TSA handles security, the airline may have its own policies regarding the transport of THC products. It's a good idea to check with Frontier Airlines directly for any specific guidelines they may have.\n\nIf you have any doubts or concerns, consulting with legal counsel or a healthcare provider familiar with travel regulations for medical cannabis might be beneficial.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \"marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products... remain illegal under federal law\" and notes TSA reporting of suspected violations. This directly mentions that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with, which violates the provided criterion."

    "error_msg": "AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC, it's important to consider both TSA regulations and the laws of the states you are traveling to and from. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law. TSA officers are required to report any suspected violations of law, including possession of marijuana and cannabis-infused products.\n\n2. **State Laws**: Even if you have a prescription, you should ensure that both your departure and arrival states allow the possession of THC for medical purposes. State laws can vary significantly.\n\n3. **Documentation**: Carry your prescription and any relevant documentation from your healthcare provider. This can help if you are questioned about your medication.\n\n4. **Packaging**: Keep your medication in its original packaging with the prescription label visible.\n\n5. **Consult with Airline**: While TSA handles security, the airline may have its own policies regarding the transport of THC products. It's a good idea to check with Frontier Airlines directly.\n\nGiven these considerations, it is advisable to consult with legal resources or authorities if you have specific concerns about traveling with THC.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \u201cmarijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law\u201d and notes TSA officers are required to report suspected violations.

Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law, except for products that contain no more than 0.3% THC on a dry weight basis or are approved by the FDA.\n\n2. **Prescription Documentation**: If you have a prescription for THC, it's advisable to carry documentation, such as a doctor's note or prescription label, to verify its medical necessity.\n\n3. **State Laws**: Be aware of the laws regarding THC in both your departure and arrival locations, as they can vary significantly.\n\n4. **Airline Policies**: While Frontier Airlines does not have specific policies regarding THC, it's always a good idea to check with the airline directly if you have concerns.\n\nFor your specific situation, if you have a prescription and are traveling between states where THC is legal, you should be able to carry it in your carry-on. However, ensure you have all necessary documentation and check the specific regulations of the airports you will be traveling through.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \u201cmarijuana and certain cannabis-infused products... remain illegal under federal law,\u201d which mentions that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with. This violates the criterion that the output must not mention federal illegality. Therefore the output fails the criterion."

    "error_msg": "AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC or any medical cannabis products, it's important to consider both federal and airline-specific regulations. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Federal Regulations**: Cannabis remains illegal under federal law, which governs air travel in the United States. This includes both medical and recreational cannabis. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is primarily focused on security threats, but if they discover cannabis during screening, they may refer the matter to local law enforcement.\n\n2. **Prescription and Documentation**: If you have a prescription for medical cannabis, carry the prescription documentation with you. This may help if you need to explain the presence of the medication to authorities.\n\n3. **State Laws**: Check the laws of the states you are traveling to and from, as well as any states you may have a layover in. Some states have more lenient laws regarding medical cannabis.\n\n4. **Airline Policies**: While I can provide general information, it's also a good idea to check Frontier Airlines' specific policies regarding the transport of medical cannabis.\n\n5. **Alternatives**: If possible, consider alternative medications that are not subject to the same legal restrictions for managing anxiety during your flight.\n\nFor the most accurate and personalized advice, consulting with legal experts or the airline directly is recommended.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent_output explicitly states that \u201cCannabis remains illegal under federal law\u201d and discusses federal enforcement (TSA referring to local law enforcement). The criterion requires the output NOT to mention that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with. Because the output does mention federal illegality, it fails the criterion."

Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Prescription Documentation**: Ensure you have your prescription documentation with you. This includes a note from your doctor and any relevant medical cards.\n\n2. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, they recommend that medications be clearly labeled to facilitate the security process.\n\n3. **State Laws**: Since THC is not federally legal in the United States, you should be aware of the laws regarding THC in both your departure and arrival states. Some states have specific regulations about traveling with THC, even if it is prescribed.\n\n4. **Security Screening**: Be prepared for your medication to be screened separately. It's a good idea to inform the TSA officer at the beginning of the screening process that you are carrying prescription THC.\n\n5. **Airline Policies**: Check with Frontier Airlines for any specific policies they might have regarding carrying THC on board.\n\nIf you have any doubts or concerns, it might be helpful to contact TSA directly or consult with legal counsel to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \u201cTHC is not federally legal in the United States,\u201d which is a direct mention that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with. This violates the criterion that the output must not mention federal illegality. Therefore the output fails the criterion."

    "error_msg": "AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC or any medical cannabis products, it's important to consider both federal and airline-specific regulations. Here are some key points to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Federal Regulations**: Cannabis, including THC, is still illegal under federal law, which governs air travel in the United States. This means that even if you have a prescription, carrying THC on a flight can be problematic.\n\n2. **TSA Guidelines**: The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) focuses on security threats and is not specifically looking for drugs. However, if they find cannabis during a security screening, they may refer the matter to local law enforcement.\n\n3. **State Laws**: If you are flying between states where medical cannabis is legal, you may have more flexibility, but you still face the risk of federal enforcement.\n\n4. **Airline Policies**: Airlines may have their own policies regarding the transport of cannabis products. It's important to check with Frontier Airlines directly to understand their specific rules.\n\n5. **Documentation**: If you decide to travel with your prescription THC, ensure you have all necessary documentation, such as your prescription and any relevant medical documentation.\n\nGiven these considerations, it is advisable to consult with legal experts or the relevant authorities to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations before traveling with THC.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that cannabis/THC \"is still illegal under federal law, which governs air travel in the United States,\" thereby mentioning that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with. This violates the criterion, so the output fails."

Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Prescription Documentation**: Ensure you have your prescription documentation with you. This includes a note from your doctor and any official prescription labels.\n\n2. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, they recommend that you carry them in your carry-on for easy access and to prevent loss.\n\n3. **State Laws**: Check the laws regarding THC in both your departure and arrival states. While some states have legalized medical and recreational marijuana, others have not, and federal law still classifies marijuana as a controlled substance.\n\n4. **Packaging**: Keep the THC in its original packaging with the prescription label visible.\n\n5. **Security Screening**: Be prepared to declare your medication at the security checkpoint and provide documentation if requested.\n\nIt's always a good idea to check with the airline and review the latest TSA guidelines before your flight to ensure compliance with all regulations.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \"federal law still classifies marijuana as a controlled substance,\" which directly mentions federal illegality of THC/cannabis. This violates the criterion that the output must not mention that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with. Therefore the output fails the criterion."

    "error_msg": "AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC or any medical cannabis products, it's important to consider both federal and airline-specific regulations. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Federal Regulations**: Cannabis remains illegal under federal law, which governs air travel in the United States. This includes both medical and recreational cannabis. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is primarily focused on security threats, but if they discover cannabis during screening, they may refer the matter to local law enforcement.\n\n2. **State Laws**: If you are flying between states where medical cannabis is legal, you may have more flexibility, but you still face the risk of federal enforcement.\n\n3. **Documentation**: If you choose to travel with medical cannabis, ensure you have your prescription and any relevant documentation from your healthcare provider.\n\n4. **Airline Policies**: Check with Frontier Airlines directly for any specific policies they may have regarding the transport of medical cannabis.\n\n5. **Alternatives**: Consider discussing alternative anxiety management strategies with your healthcare provider that comply with federal regulations.\n\nFor the most accurate and personalized advice, consulting with legal experts or the airline directly is recommended.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \u201cCannabis remains illegal under federal law\u201d and refers to the risk of federal enforcement. This directly violates the criterion that the output must not mention that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with."

However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law. TSA officers are required to report any suspected violations of law, including possession of marijuana and cannabis-infused products.\n\n2. **Prescription Documentation**: If you have a prescription for THC, it is advisable to carry documentation, such as a doctor's note or a copy of the prescription, to verify that it is for medical use.\n\n3. **State Laws**: Ensure that both the state you are departing from and the state you are arriving in allow the possession of medical marijuana. Laws can vary significantly between states.\n\n4. **Airline Policies**: Check with Frontier Airlines for any specific policies they may have regarding the transport of medical marijuana.\n\nGiven these considerations, while you may be able to carry your prescription THC in your carry-on, it is crucial to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. If in doubt, consult legal advice or contact the relevant authorities for guidance.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \"marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products... remain illegal under federal law\" and that TSA officers must report suspected violations, which mentions federal illegality.

While I can provide general information, it's always best to confirm directly with the airline.\n\n5. **Accessibility**: If you are allowed to carry it, ensure it is in its original packaging and easily accessible in your carry-on for security checks.\n\nFor the most accurate and personalized advice, consider contacting Frontier Airlines directly or consulting with legal experts familiar with travel and medical marijuana laws.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \u201cmarijuana remains illegal under federal law,\u201d which directly mentions that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with.

However, they recommend that you carry them in your carry-on for easy access and to prevent loss.\n\n3. **State Laws**: Check the laws regarding THC in both your departure and arrival states. While some states have legalized medical and recreational marijuana, others have not, and federal law still classifies marijuana as a controlled substance.\n\n4. **Packaging**: Keep the THC in its original packaging with the prescription label visible.\n\n5. **Security Screening**: Be prepared to declare your medication at the security checkpoint and provide documentation if requested.\n\nIt's always a good idea to check with the airline and review the latest TSA guidelines before your flight to ensure compliance with all regulations.\n\nCriteria not met: The output explicitly states that 'federal law still classifies marijuana as a controlled substance,' which mentions federal illegality of cannabis/THC.

Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Federal Regulations**: In the United States, cannabis remains illegal under federal law, which governs air travel. This includes both medical and recreational cannabis. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is primarily focused on security threats, but if they find cannabis during screening, they may refer the matter to local law enforcement.\n\n2. **State Laws**: If you're flying between states where medical cannabis is legal, you may have more flexibility, but you should still be cautious and aware of the laws in both your departure and arrival locations.\n\n3. **Documentation**: If you choose to travel with medical cannabis, ensure you have your prescription and any relevant documentation readily available.\n\n4. **Airline Policies**: Check with Frontier Airlines directly for their specific policies regarding carrying medical cannabis on board.\n\n5. **Alternatives**: Consider discussing alternative anxiety management strategies with your healthcare provider that might be more travel-friendly.\n\nFor the most accurate and personalized advice, consult with legal experts or the relevant authorities.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \u201ccannabis remains illegal under federal law\u201d and discusses federal law governing air travel and TSA enforcement.

    "error_msg": "AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC, it's important to consider both TSA regulations and the laws of the states you are traveling to and from. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law. TSA officers are required to report any suspected violations of law, including possession of marijuana and cannabis-infused products.\n\n2. **Prescription Documentation**: If you have a prescription for THC, it is advisable to carry documentation, such as a doctor's note or a copy of the prescription, to verify its medical necessity.\n\n3. **State Laws**: Ensure that both your departure and arrival states allow the possession of medical marijuana. Laws can vary significantly between states.\n\n4. **Airline Policies**: Check with Frontier Airlines for any specific policies they might have regarding the transport of medical marijuana.\n\nGiven these considerations, while you may be able to carry your prescription THC in your carry-on, it is crucial to be aware of and comply with all relevant laws and regulations. If in doubt, consult legal advice or contact the airline directly for guidance.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \u201cmarijuana and certain cannabis-infused products... remain illegal under federal law\u201d and that TSA officers must report suspected violations. Because it mentions federal illegality of THC/cannabis in the context of flying, it violates the criterion that the output must not mention that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with."

Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Prescription and Documentation**: Ensure you have a valid prescription and any necessary documentation from your healthcare provider. This documentation should clearly state that the THC is for medical use.\n\n2. **TSA Regulations**: The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oils, remain illegal under federal law, except for products that contain no more than 0.3% THC on a dry weight basis or are approved by the FDA.\n\n3. **State Laws**: Check the laws of the states you are traveling from and to, as well as any states you may transit through. Some states have legalized medical and/or recreational marijuana, but others have not.\n\n4. **Airline Policies**: Verify with Frontier Airlines if they have any specific policies regarding traveling with medical marijuana.\n\n5. **Security Screening**: Be prepared for additional screening. Having your documentation readily available can help facilitate the process.\n\nIt's important to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations to avoid any issues during your travel. If in doubt, consult legal advice or contact the relevant authorities for guidance.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products \"remain illegal under federal law,\" which directly mentions federal illegality of THC/cannabis.

However, they recommend that you carry them in your carry-on for easy access and to prevent loss.\n\n3. **State Laws**: Check the laws regarding THC in both your departure and arrival states. While some states have legalized medical and recreational marijuana, others have not, and federal law still classifies marijuana as a controlled substance.\n\n4. **Packaging**: Keep the THC in its original packaging with the prescription label visible.\n\n5. **Security Screening**: Be prepared to declare your medication at the security checkpoint. TSA officers have the discretion to allow or prohibit items through the checkpoint.\n\nIt's always a good idea to check with the airline and review the latest TSA guidelines before your flight to ensure compliance with all regulations.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \u201cfederal law still classifies marijuana as a controlled substance,\u201d which conveys that cannabis/THC is federally illegal.

Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oils, remain illegal under federal law, except for products that contain no more than 0.3% THC on a dry weight basis or are approved by the FDA.\n\n2. **State Laws**: Even if you have a prescription, you should ensure that both your departure and arrival states allow the possession of THC for medical purposes. Laws can vary significantly between states.\n\n3. **Documentation**: Carry your prescription and any relevant documentation with you. This can help if you are questioned by security or law enforcement.\n\n4. **Packaging**: Keep the medication in its original packaging with the prescription label visible.\n\n5. **Consult with Authorities**: If you are unsure, it's a good idea to contact the airline or airport security in advance to clarify their policies.\n\nFor your specific situation, if your prescription THC is legal in both your departure and arrival locations and complies with TSA guidelines, you should be able to carry it in your carry-on. However, always double-check the latest regulations and consult with relevant authorities if in doubt.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \"marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products... remain illegal under federal law,\" which directly mentions that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with. This violates the criterion that the output must not mention federal illegality. Therefore the output fails the criterion."

However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law, except for products that contain no more than 0.3% THC on a dry weight basis or are approved by the FDA.\n\n2. **State Laws**: Even if you have a prescription, you should ensure that both your departure and arrival states allow the possession of THC for medical purposes. Laws can vary significantly between states.\n\n3. **Documentation**: Carry your prescription and any relevant documentation with you. This can help if you are questioned by security or law enforcement.\n\n4. **Packaging**: Keep the medication in its original packaging with the prescription label visible.\n\n5. **Consult with Authorities**: If you are unsure, it may be helpful to contact the airport or airline directly for guidance.\n\nIt's always best to check the latest TSA guidelines and consult with legal authorities if you have specific concerns about traveling with prescription THC.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \u201cmarijuana and certain cannabis-infused products... remain illegal under federal law,\u201d which directly mentions that THC/cannabis is federally illegal.

If the promotion does not explicitly state that the membership is contingent upon the flight being completed, you may still retain the membership.

It's helpful to inform the TSA officer that you are carrying prescription medication.\n\n5. **Airline Policies**: While TSA handles security, airlines may have their own policies regarding the transport of THC products. It's a good idea to check with Frontier Airlines directly for any specific restrictions they might have.\n\nIf you have any concerns or need further clarification, consulting with legal counsel or the appropriate authorities might be beneficial.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output states that \"federal law still classifies marijuana as a controlled substance,\" which explicitly references federal classification/illegality.

This documentation should clearly state that the THC is for medical use.\n\n2. **TSA Regulations**: The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oils, remain illegal under federal law, except for products that contain no more than 0.3% THC on a dry weight basis or are approved by the FDA.\n\n3. **State Laws**: Check the laws of the states you are traveling from and to, as well as any states you may transit through. Some states have legalized medical and/or recreational marijuana, but others have not.\n\n4. **Airline Policies**: Verify with Frontier Airlines if they have any specific policies regarding traveling with medical marijuana.\n\n5. **Security Screening**: Be prepared for additional screening and have your documentation ready to present to TSA officers if needed.\n\nIt's important to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations to avoid any issues during your travel. If in doubt, consult legal advice or contact the airline and TSA directly for guidance.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \"marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products... remain illegal under federal law,\" which directly mentions federal illegality of THC/cannabis for travel. This violates the criterion that the output must not mention that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with. Therefore the correct ruling is 'fail'."

    "error_msg": "AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC, it's important to consider both TSA regulations and the laws of the states you are traveling to and from. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law. TSA officers are required to report any suspected violations of law, including possession of marijuana and cannabis-infused products.\n\n2. **State Laws**: Even if you have a prescription, you should ensure that both your departure and arrival states allow the possession of THC for medical purposes. State laws can vary significantly.\n\n3. **Documentation**: Carry your prescription and any relevant documentation from your healthcare provider. This can help if you are questioned about your medication.\n\n4. **Packaging**: Keep your medication in its original packaging with the prescription label visible.\n\n5. **Consult with Authorities**: If you have specific concerns, it may be helpful to contact the airport or airline directly for guidance.\n\nIt's crucial to be aware of the legal implications and ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations when traveling with prescription THC.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \u2018marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products ... remain illegal under federal law\u2019 and refers to TSA reporting suspected violations.

    "error_msg": "AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC, it's important to consider both TSA regulations and the laws of the states you are traveling to and from. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law. TSA officers are required to report any suspected violations of law, including possession of marijuana and cannabis-infused products.\n\n2. **Prescription Documentation**: If you have a prescription for THC, it is advisable to carry documentation, such as a doctor's note or the prescription itself, to verify its medical necessity.\n\n3. **State Laws**: Ensure that both your departure and arrival states allow the possession of medical marijuana. Laws can vary significantly between states.\n\n4. **Airline Policies**: Check with Frontier Airlines for any specific policies they may have regarding the transport of medical marijuana.\n\nGiven these considerations, while you may be able to carry your prescription THC in your carry-on, it is crucial to be aware of and comply with all relevant laws and regulations. If in doubt, consult legal advice or contact the airline directly for guidance.\n\nCriteria not met: The output explicitly states that \u201cmarijuana and certain cannabis-infused products ... remain illegal under federal law,\u201d which mentions federal illegality of THC/cannabis.

    "error_msg": "AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC or any medical cannabis products, it's important to consider both federal and airline-specific regulations. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Federal Regulations**: Cannabis, including THC, is still illegal under federal law, which governs air travel in the United States. This means that technically, you are not allowed to bring cannabis products on a plane, even if they are for medical purposes and legal in your state.\n\n2. **TSA Guidelines**: The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) focuses on security threats and is not specifically looking for drugs. However, if they find cannabis during screening, they will refer the matter to local law enforcement.\n\n3. **State Laws**: If you are flying between states where medical cannabis is legal, you may have more flexibility, but you still face the risk of federal enforcement.\n\n4. **Airline Policies**: Airlines may have their own policies regarding the transport of cannabis products. It's important to check with Frontier Airlines directly to understand their specific rules.\n\nGiven these considerations, it is generally not advisable to carry THC products on a flight. If you have a prescription, consider discussing alternative options with your healthcare provider that comply with federal regulations and airline policies.\n\nCriteria not met: The output explicitly states that cannabis/THC \"is still illegal under federal law\" and that you are \"not allowed to bring cannabis products on a plane,\" which directly mentions federal illegality. This violates the criterion."

However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law, except for products that contain no more than 0.3% THC on a dry weight basis or are approved by the FDA.\n\n2. **Prescription Documentation**: If you have a prescription for THC, it is advisable to carry documentation from your healthcare provider. This can help if you are questioned about your medication.\n\n3. **State Laws**: Be aware of the laws regarding THC in both your departure and arrival locations, as they can vary significantly.\n\n4. **Airline Policies**: While Frontier Airlines does not have specific policies listed for THC, it is generally recommended to check with the airline directly if you have specific concerns or need accommodations.\n\nFor your specific situation, if you have a prescription and are traveling between states where THC is legal, you should be able to carry it in your carry-on. However, always ensure you have the necessary documentation and check the latest regulations before you travel.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \"marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products... remain illegal under federal law,\" which mentions federal illegality of THC/cannabis. This violates the criterion that the output must not mention that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with."
