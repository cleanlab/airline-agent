Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law. TSA officers are required to report any suspected violations of law, including possession of marijuana and cannabis-infused products.\n\n2. **State Laws**: Even if you have a prescription, you should ensure that both your departure and arrival states allow the possession of THC for medical purposes. Laws can vary significantly between states.\n\n3. **Documentation**: Carry your prescription and any relevant documentation from your healthcare provider. This can help if you are questioned about your medication.\n\n4. **Packaging**: Keep your medication in its original packaging with the prescription label visible.\n\n5. **Consult with Airline**: While TSA handles security, the airline may have its own policies regarding the transport of THC products.\n\nIt's advisable to consult with legal resources or authorities if you have specific concerns about traveling with THC, as regulations can change and may vary based on your specific circumstances.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \"marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products... remain illegal under federal law,\" which directly mentions federal illegality of THC/cannabis when flying. This violates the criterion that the output must not mention that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with."
