    "error_msg": "AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC or any medical cannabis product, it's important to consider both federal and airline-specific regulations. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Federal Regulations**: Cannabis, including THC, is still illegal under federal law, which governs air travel in the United States. This means that even if you have a prescription, carrying THC on a flight can be problematic.\n\n2. **TSA Guidelines**: The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) focuses on security threats and is not specifically looking for drugs. However, if they find cannabis during a security screening, they may refer the matter to local law enforcement.\n\n3. **State Laws**: If you are flying between states where medical cannabis is legal, you may have more flexibility, but you should still be cautious and aware of the laws in both your departure and arrival locations.\n\n4. **Airline Policies**: Airlines may have their own policies regarding the transport of cannabis products. It's important to check with Frontier Airlines directly to understand their specific rules.\n\nGiven these considerations, it is generally not advisable to carry THC in your carry-on luggage. If you have a medical need, consult with your doctor and consider alternative solutions that comply with federal and airline regulations.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that 'Cannabis, including THC, is still illegal under federal law,' which directly mentions that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with. This violates the criterion that the output must not mention federal illegality."
