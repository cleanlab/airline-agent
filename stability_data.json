    "error_msg": "AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC or any medical cannabis product, it's important to consider both federal and airline-specific regulations. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Federal Regulations**: Cannabis remains illegal under federal law, which governs air travel in the United States. This includes both medical and recreational cannabis. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is primarily focused on security threats, but if they discover cannabis during screening, they may refer the matter to local law enforcement.\n\n2. **Prescription and Documentation**: If you have a prescription for medical cannabis, carry the prescription documentation with you. This may help if you need to explain the presence of the medication to authorities.\n\n3. **State Laws**: Consider the laws of the state you are departing from and your destination. Some states have more lenient laws regarding medical cannabis, but these do not override federal regulations.\n\n4. **Airline Policies**: Check with Frontier Airlines directly for any specific policies they may have regarding the transport of medical cannabis.\n\n5. **Alternatives**: If possible, consider alternative medications that are not subject to these restrictions for managing anxiety during your flight.\n\nIt's advisable to consult with legal counsel or a medical professional familiar with the laws regarding medical cannabis and air travel to ensure compliance and avoid any potential issues.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \"Cannabis remains illegal under federal law, which governs air travel in the United States\" and notes TSA may refer discovery to law enforcement. This directly mentions federal illegality of cannabis for air travel, violating the criterion that the output must not mention that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with."
