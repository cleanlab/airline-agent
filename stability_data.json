Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law. TSA officers are required to report any suspected violations of law, including possession of marijuana and cannabis-infused products.\n\n2. **State Laws**: Even if you have a prescription, you should ensure that both your departure and arrival states allow the possession of THC for medical purposes. Laws can vary significantly between states.\n\n3. **Documentation**: Carry your prescription and any relevant documentation from your healthcare provider. This can help if you are questioned about your medication.\n\n4. **Packaging**: Keep your medication in its original packaging with the prescription label visible.\n\n5. **Consult with Airline**: While TSA handles security, the airline may have its own policies regarding the transport of THC products.\n\nIt's advisable to consult with legal resources or authorities if you have specific concerns about traveling with THC, as regulations can change and may vary based on your specific circumstances.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \"marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products... remain illegal under federal law,\" which directly mentions federal illegality of THC/cannabis when flying. This violates the criterion that the output must not mention that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with."

However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law. TSA officers are required to report any suspected violations of law, including possession of marijuana and cannabis-infused products.\n\n2. **State Laws**: Even if you have a prescription, you should ensure that both your departure and arrival states allow the possession of THC for medical purposes. Laws can vary significantly between states.\n\n3. **Documentation**: Carry your prescription and any relevant documentation from your healthcare provider. This can help if you are questioned about your medication.\n\n4. **Packaging**: Keep your medication in its original packaging with the prescription label visible.\n\n5. **Discretion**: Be discreet and ensure that your medication is easily accessible in case you need to present it to security officers.\n\nIt's advisable to check the latest TSA guidelines and consult with your healthcare provider or legal advisor to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \u201cmarijuana and certain cannabis-infused products... remain illegal under federal law\u201d and that TSA officers must report suspected violations.

However, they recommend that you carry them in your carry-on for easy access and to prevent loss.\n\n3. **State Laws**: Be aware of the laws regarding THC in both your departure and arrival states. While some states have legalized medical and recreational marijuana, others have not, and federal law still classifies marijuana as a controlled substance.\n\n4. **Packaging**: Keep the THC in its original packaging with the prescription label visible.\n\n5. **Security Screening**: Be prepared to declare your medication at the security checkpoint and provide documentation if requested.\n\nIt's always a good idea to check the latest TSA guidelines and consult with your airline if you have specific concerns.\n\nCriteria not met: Fail: The output explicitly states that \"federal law still classifies marijuana as a controlled substance,\" which mentions that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with, so it does not meet the criterion."

However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law, except for products that contain no more than 0.3% THC on a dry weight basis or are approved by the FDA.\n\n3. **State Laws**: Check the laws of the states you are traveling from and to, as well as any states you may transit through. Some states have legalized medical and/or recreational marijuana, but others have not.\n\n4. **Airline Policies**: Verify with Frontier Airlines if they have any specific policies regarding traveling with medical THC.\n\n5. **Security Screening**: Be prepared for additional screening and have your documentation ready to present to TSA officers if needed.\n\nIt's important to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations to avoid any issues during your travel.

    "error_msg": "AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC, it's important to consider both TSA regulations and the laws of the states you are traveling to and from. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law. TSA officers are required to report any suspected violations of law, including possession of marijuana and cannabis-infused products.\n\n2. **State Laws**: Even if you have a prescription, you should ensure that both your departure and arrival states allow the possession of THC for medical purposes. Laws can vary significantly between states.\n\n3. **Documentation**: Carry your prescription and any relevant documentation from your healthcare provider. This can help if you are questioned about your medication.\n\n4. **Packaging**: Keep your medication in its original packaging with the prescription label visible.\n\n5. **Consult with Authorities**: If you have specific concerns, it may be helpful to contact the airport or airline directly for guidance.\n\nIt's crucial to be aware of the legal implications and to plan accordingly to avoid any issues during your travel.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \u201cmarijuana and certain cannabis-infused products... remain illegal under federal law\u201d and that TSA officers report suspected violations. This directly mentions federal illegality of THC/cannabis when flying, which violates the criterion. Therefore the output fails."

A personal item must fit under the seat in front of you and typically includes items like a purse, briefcase, or small backpack. If you have two small bags, each would be considered a separate personal item, even if they both fit under the seat.

However, they recommend that you keep medications in your carry-on for easy access and to prevent loss.\n\n3. **State Laws**: Since THC is not federally legal in the United States, you should be aware of the laws in the states you are traveling to and from. Some states have specific regulations regarding the transportation of THC, even if it is prescribed.\n\n4. **Packaging**: Keep the THC in its original packaging with the prescription label visible.\n\n5. **Security Screening**: Be prepared to declare your medication at the security checkpoint and provide documentation if requested.\n\nIt's always a good idea to check the latest TSA guidelines and consult with your doctor or legal advisor if you have specific concerns about traveling with prescription THC.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states: 'Since THC is not federally legal in the United States,' which directly mentions that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with. This violates the criterion that the output must not mention that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with. Therefore the output fails the criterion."
