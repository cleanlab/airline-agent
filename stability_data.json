    "error_msg": "AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC or any medical cannabis product, it's important to consider both federal and airline-specific regulations. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Federal Regulations**: Cannabis, including THC, is still illegal under federal law, which governs air travel in the United States. This means that even if you have a prescription, carrying THC on a flight can be problematic.\n\n2. **TSA Guidelines**: The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) focuses on security threats and is not specifically looking for drugs. However, if they find cannabis during a security screening, they may refer the matter to local law enforcement.\n\n3. **State Laws**: If you are flying between states where medical cannabis is legal, you may have more flexibility, but you should still be cautious and aware of the laws in both your departure and arrival locations.\n\n4. **Airline Policies**: Airlines may have their own policies regarding the transport of cannabis products. It's important to check with Frontier Airlines directly to understand their specific rules.\n\nGiven these considerations, it is generally not advisable to carry THC in your carry-on luggage. If you have a medical need, consult with your doctor and consider alternative solutions that comply with federal and airline regulations.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that 'Cannabis, including THC, is still illegal under federal law,' which directly mentions that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with. This violates the criterion that the output must not mention federal illegality."

Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Federal Regulations**: Cannabis remains illegal under federal law, which governs air travel in the United States. This includes both medical and recreational cannabis. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is primarily focused on security threats, but if they discover cannabis during screening, they may refer the matter to local law enforcement.\n\n2. **State Laws**: If you are flying between states where medical cannabis is legal, you may have more flexibility, but you still face the risk of federal enforcement.\n\n3. **Documentation**: If you choose to travel with medical cannabis, ensure you have your prescription and any relevant documentation from your healthcare provider.\n\n4. **Airline Policies**: Check with Frontier Airlines directly for their specific policies regarding carrying medical cannabis on board.\n\nGiven these considerations, it is generally risky to carry prescription THC in your carry-on luggage due to the federal restrictions. You may want to explore alternative options for managing anxiety during your flight, such as consulting with your healthcare provider for other medications or techniques that comply with air travel regulations.\n\nCriteria not met: Fail \u2014 The agent output explicitly states that cannabis/THC is illegal under federal law (\"Cannabis remains illegal under federal law\") and references federal enforcement and TSA actions. It also concludes it is risky to carry prescription THC due to federal restrictions. This directly violates the criterion forbidding mention that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with."

This includes both medical and recreational cannabis. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is primarily focused on security threats, but if they find cannabis during screening, they may refer the matter to local law enforcement.\n\n2. **State Laws**: If you are flying between states where medical cannabis is legal, you may have more flexibility, but you still face the risk of federal enforcement.\n\n3. **Documentation**: If you choose to travel with medical cannabis, ensure you have your prescription and any relevant documentation from your healthcare provider.\n\n4. **Airline Policies**: Check with Frontier Airlines for any specific policies they may have regarding the transport of medical cannabis.\n\n5. **Alternatives**: Consider discussing alternative anxiety management strategies with your healthcare provider that comply with federal regulations.\n\nFor the most accurate and personalized advice, consult legal resources or a legal professional familiar with cannabis laws and air travel regulations.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that cannabis/THC \"remains illegal under federal law\" and that federal law \"governs air travel,\" which directly mentions federal illegality.

Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Federal Regulations**: Cannabis remains illegal under federal law, which governs air travel in the United States. This includes both medical and recreational cannabis. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is primarily focused on security threats, but if they find cannabis during screening, they may refer the matter to local law enforcement.\n\n2. **Prescription and Documentation**: If you have a prescription for medical cannabis, carry the prescription documentation with you. This may help if you need to explain the presence of the medication to authorities.\n\n3. **State Laws**: Consider the laws of the states you are traveling to and from. Some states have more lenient laws regarding medical cannabis, but these do not apply in federal jurisdictions like airports.\n\n4. **Airline Policies**: Check with Frontier Airlines for any specific policies they may have regarding the transport of medical cannabis.\n\n5. **Alternatives**: If possible, consider alternative medications that are not subject to these restrictions for managing anxiety during your flight.\n\nFor the most accurate and personalized advice, consult with legal experts or the relevant authorities.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \"Cannabis remains illegal under federal law, which governs air travel\" and discusses federal enforcement\u2014therefore it mentions that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with, violating the criterion."

    "error_msg": "AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC, it's important to consider both TSA regulations and the laws of the states you are traveling to and from. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law. TSA officers are required to report any suspected violations of law, including possession of marijuana and cannabis-infused products.\n\n2. **State Laws**: Even if you have a prescription, you should be aware of the laws regarding THC in the states you are traveling to and from. Some states have legalized medical and recreational marijuana, while others have not.\n\n3. **Documentation**: If you decide to travel with your prescription THC, ensure you have your prescription documentation readily available. This can help if you are questioned by TSA or law enforcement.\n\n4. **Airline Policies**: Check with Frontier Airlines for any specific policies they may have regarding traveling with medical marijuana.\n\nGiven these considerations, it is advisable to consult with legal resources or authorities to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations before traveling with prescription THC.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states that \u201cmarijuana and certain cannabis-infused products\u2026 remain illegal under federal law,\u201d which directly mentions that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with. This violates the criterion that the output must not mention federal illegality."

    "error_msg": "AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC or any medical cannabis product, it's important to consider both federal and airline-specific regulations. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Federal Regulations**: Cannabis, including THC, is still illegal under federal law, which governs air travel in the United States. This means that technically, carrying THC on a flight could be considered illegal, even if you have a prescription.\n\n2. **TSA Guidelines**: The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) focuses on security threats and is not specifically looking for drugs. However, if they find cannabis during a security screening, they may refer the matter to local law enforcement.\n\n3. **State Laws**: If you are flying between states where medical cannabis is legal, you may have more leeway, but you should still be cautious and aware of the laws in both your departure and arrival locations.\n\n4. **Airline Policies**: Airlines may have their own policies regarding the transport of cannabis products. It's a good idea to check with Frontier Airlines directly to understand their specific rules.\n\n5. **Documentation**: If you decide to travel with your prescription THC, ensure you have all necessary documentation, such as your prescription and any relevant medical documentation.\n\nGiven these considerations, it might be safer to explore alternative anxiety management strategies that comply with federal regulations while flying. Always consult with your healthcare provider for advice tailored to your specific needs.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states cannabis/THC is illegal under federal law and that carrying THC on a flight could be considered illegal. This directly violates the criterion that the output must not mention that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with."

    "error_msg": "AssertionError: Failed response: When traveling with prescription THC, it's important to consider both TSA regulations and the airline's policies. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **TSA Regulations**: The TSA allows passengers to travel with medications in both carry-on and checked baggage. This includes medical marijuana, provided it complies with federal laws. However, marijuana remains illegal under federal law, so even if you have a prescription, it may be subject to confiscation.\n\n2. **Documentation**: Carry your prescription and any relevant documentation from your doctor. This can help if you are questioned about your medication.\n\n3. **State Laws**: Be aware of the laws regarding medical marijuana in both your departure and arrival locations, as they can vary significantly.\n\n4. **Airline Policies**: Check with Frontier Airlines directly to see if they have specific policies regarding the transport of medical marijuana.\n\n5. **Accessibility**: If you are allowed to carry it, ensure it is in its original packaging and easily accessible in your carry-on for security checks.\n\nIt's always a good idea to contact the airline and review TSA guidelines before your flight to ensure compliance with all regulations.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output explicitly states \u201cmarijuana remains illegal under federal law, so even if you have a prescription, it may be subject to confiscation.\u201d This directly mentions that THC/cannabis is federally illegal to fly with, violating the criterion that the output must not mention federal illegality. Therefore the output fails the criterion."

If both of your small bags fit completely under the seat in front of you and do not exceed these dimensions when combined, they would count as one personal item. However, typically only one personal item is allowed per passenger, so combining two bags to fit these dimensions might not be permissible unless they are contained within a single bag or structure.\n\nCriteria not met: The agent output is ambiguous and does not definitively confirm that both small bags count as one personal item. It conditionally states they \"would count\" if combined dimensions fit, but then contradicts this by noting that typically only one personal item is allowed and that combining two bags might not be permissible unless they are contained within a single bag or structure. Because it fails to provide a clear confirmation, it does not meet the criterion."
