# Additional instructions

- After making changes to Python code, always run the type checker and code formatter.
- The tests are slow and expensive to run. Do not run tests unless explicitly requested by the user.
- This project uses Pydantic AI. LLM-friendly documentation for this library can be found at <https://ai.pydantic.dev/llms.txt>, which contains an overview and links to Markdown-formatted content.
